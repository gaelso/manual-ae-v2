(ref:eucal) Eucalyptus plantation in the Republic of the Congo. Top is the Kissoko area, an illustration of savannah-plantation mosaics. Bottom is the Kondi area in operation, an illustration of the main destinations for eucalyptus wood (logs for paper pulp and charcoal production for the city of Pointe-Noire (photos: L. Saint-Andr√©).

(ref:mix) Heterogeneous stands. On the left, multispecific stands on Mont Saint-Anne in Quebec; on the right, multispecific, uneven-aged stands in Costa-Rica (photo: B. Locatelli).

(ref:plan) Sampling plan optimizing volume prediction precision for a particular tree. The size deviation $\Delta$ must be as large as possible.

(ref:bad) Volume prediction based on a linear regression constructed using extreme points (in black) when the size-volume relationship is indeed linear (left) and when it is not (right). The black points are the same in both cases. The star indicates the volume predicted by the linear regression constructed using the black points while the gray points indicate the real volume corresponding to $D^{*2}H^*$.
