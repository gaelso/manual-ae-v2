<!-- Tables chapter 2 -->

(ref:eff) Number of trees to be measured to establish a volume table for different surface areas over which the tables are to be used: recommendations by @parde88.

(ref:c03) Coefficient of variation in relation to plot size: data drawn from Table 5 by @chave03 for Barro Colorado Island, Panama.


<!-- Tables chapter 4 -->

(ref:one) Data entry with four nested levels in a single data table.

(ref:datashort) Tree biomass data from @henry10 in Ghana.

(ref:data) Tree biomass data from @henry10 in Ghana. `dbh` is diameter at breast height in cm, `heig` is height in m, `houp` is the diameter of the crown in m, `dens` is mean wood density in g cm^-3^, `volume` is volume in m^3^, `Bbran` is the dry biomass of the branches in tonnes, `Bfol` is the dry biomass of the foliage in tonnes, `Btronc` is the dry biomass of the trunk in tonnes, `Bctf` is the dry mass of the buttresses in tonnes, and `Btot` is total dry biomass in tonnes.

(ref:datasp) Data on the species sampled by @henry10 in Ghana.


<!-- Tables chapter 5 -->

(ref:prim) A few models linking two variables.


<!-- Tables chapter 6 -->

(ref:fAICD) AIC values for 10 biomass tables fitted to data from 42 trees measured in Ghana by @henry10. These 10 tables directly predict biomass.
