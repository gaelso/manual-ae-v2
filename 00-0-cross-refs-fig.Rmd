<!-- Figures chapter 1 --> 

(ref:eucal) Eucalyptus plantation in the Republic of the Congo. Top is the Kissoko area, an illustration of savannah-plantation mosaics. Bottom is the Kondi area in operation, an illustration of the main destinations for eucalyptus wood (logs for paper pulp and charcoal production for the city of Pointe-Noire (photos: L. Saint-André).

(ref:mix) Heterogeneous stands. On the left, multispecific stands on Mont Saint-Anne in Quebec; on the right, multispecific, uneven-aged stands in Costa-Rica (photo: B. Locatelli).


<!-- Figures chapter 2 --> 

(ref:plan) Sampling plan optimizing volume prediction precision for a particular tree. The size deviation $\Delta$ must be as large as possible.

(ref:bad) Volume prediction based on a linear regression constructed using extreme points (in black) when the size-volume relationship is indeed linear (left) and when it is not (right). The black points are the same in both cases. The star indicates the volume predicted by the linear regression constructed using the black points while the gray points indicate the real volume corresponding to $D^{*2}H^*$.

(ref:mel) Predicting volume from tree size in two strata (black and white points): top left: the two strata corresponding to the two variances of the residuals (higher variance for the white than the black points) but the relationship is the same; top right: both the variance and the relation are different in the two strata; bottom: the situation is the same as top right but the second stratum has been subsampled such that we are led to believe that we are dealing with the same relation in the two strata.


<!-- Figures chapter 3 --> 

(ref:post) Organization of a biomass measurement site with 7 different operations. Operation 1, site preparation and felling of the trees (photo: L. Saint-André); operation 2, measurement of felled trees: stem profile, marking for cross-cutting (photo: M. Rivoire); operation 3, stripping of leaves and limbing (photo: R. D'Annunzio and M. Rivoire); operation 4, cross-cutting into logs and disks (photo: C. Nys); operation 5, weighing of logs and brushwood (photo: J.-F. Picard); operation 6, sampling of branches (photo: M. Rivoire); operation 7, sample weighing area (photo: M. Rivoire).
