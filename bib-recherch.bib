  author = {{\O}ksendal, B.},
  pages = {324},
  address = {Berlin},
  edition = {5},
  abstract = {This book gives an introduction to the basic theory of stochastic
	calculus and its applications. Examples are given throughout the
	text, in order to motivate and illustrate the theory and show its
	importance for many applications in e.g. economics, biology and physics.
	The basic idea of the presentation is to start from some basic results
	(without proofs) of the easier cases and develop the theory from
	there, and to concentrate on the proofs of the easier case (which
	nevertheless are often sufficiently general for many purposes) in
	order to be able to reach quickly the parts of the theory which is
	most important for the applications. The new feature of this 5th
	edition is an extra chapter on applications to mathematical finance.
	This well-established textbook on stochastic differential equations
	has turned out to be very useful to no-specialists of the subject
	and has sold steadily in 4 editions, both in the EU and US market.
	Contents: Introduction.- Some Mathematical Preliminaries.- Ito Integrals.-
	Ito Processes and the Ito Formula.- Stochastic Differential Equations.-

	gradients of aspect and elevation. Potential incident solar radiation
	(insolation) was estimated from a geographic information system to
	quantify microclimate affinities of these species across north- and
	south-facing slopes. At the community level, leaf size and SLA both
	declined with increasing insolation, based on average trait values
	for the species found in plots along the gradient. However, leaf
	size and SLA were not significantly correlated across species, suggesting
	that these two traits are decoupled and associated with different
	aspects of performance along this environmental gradient. For individual
	species, SLA was negatively correlated with species distributions
	along the insolation gradient, and was significantly lower in evergreen
	versus deciduous species. Leaf size exhibited a negative but non-significant
	trend in relation to insolation distribution of individual species.
	At the community level, variance in leaf size increased with increasing
	insolation. For individual species, there was a greater range of
	leaf size on south-facing slopes, while there was an absence of small-leaved
	species on north-facing slopes. These results demonstrate that analyses
	of plant functional traits along environmental gradients based on
	community level averages may obscure important aspects of trait variation
	and distribution among the constituent species.},

  abstract = {We review deterministic and stochastic demographic models as well
	as classical population genetic models that have been applied to
	tropical rain forest tree species. We discuss their implications
	for conservation. The main conclusions of deterministic demographic
	models are the key importance of species' longevity in determining
	susceptibility of population growth rate to harvesting of individuals
	at different life-stages, the critical effect of patch dynamics,
	and the importance of density-dependent mechanisms at least for abundant
	species. Population viability analysis to predict extinction times
	of tropical rain forest tree species has only been performed for
	four tropical rain forest tree species using the simplest Lefkovitch
	matrix linear model. Results obtained are in accordance with results
	of simple stochastic models for nonstructured populations that have
	been solved analytically. Population genetic models have shown that
	tropical rain forest trees: (a) possess high levels of genetic diversity,
	(b) maintain greater proportions of genetic variation within than
	among populations, (c) are predominantly outcrossed, and (d) have
	high levels of gene flow. These results suggest that tropical tree
	species may not be in immediate danger of extinction from genetic
	factors if actual conditions are maintained. However, the impact
	of forest fragmentation is expected to be particularly strong for
	most tropical rain forest tree species due mainly to the high genetic
	load kept by their present population genetic structures. Recent
	theoretical demographic-genetic models for simple systems suggest
	that the fixation of new mildly detrimental mutations may be comparable
	in importance to environmental stochasticity, implying minimum viable
	populations as large as a few thousands. It is urgent to develop
	a model that integrates genetic and demographic factors, that enables
	evaluations of their relative importance in long-term persistence
	of tropical rain forest tree species.},

  abstract = {The increasing interest in biodiversity conservation has led to the

	effective methods for the classification of forest types constitutes
	a crucial issue as forests represent the most widespread vegetation
	structure and play a key role in ecosystem functioning. In this study
	a maximum entropy approach (Maxent) to forest type classification
	in a complex Mediterranean area, has been investigated. Maxent, a
	niche-based model of species/habitat distribution, allowed researchers
	to estimate the potential distribution of four forest types: Holm
	oak, Mixed oak, Mixed broadleaved and Riparian forests. The Maxent
	model's internal tests have proved a powerful tool for estimating
	the model's accuracy and analyzing the effects of the most important

	from demonstration technology to a key tool for assessing carbon
	stocks in tropical forests. With its ability to penetrate tropical
	forest canopies and detect three-dimensional forest structure, LiDAR
	may prove to be a major component of international strategies to
	measure and account for carbon emissions from and uptake by tropical
	forests. To date, however, basic ecological information such as height?diameter
	allometry and stand-level wood density have not been mechanistically
	incorporated into methods for mapping forest carbon at regional and
	global scales. A better incorporation of these structural patterns
	in forests may reduce the considerable time needed to calibrate airborne
	data with ground-based forest inventory plots, which presently necessitate
	exhaustive measurements of tree diameters and heights, as well as
	tree identifications for wood density estimation. Here, we develop
	a new approach that can facilitate rapid LiDAR calibration with minimal
	field data. Throughout four tropical regions (Panama, Peru, Madagascar,
	and Hawaii), we were able to predict aboveground carbon density estimated
	in field inventory plots using a single universal LiDAR model (r
	2 = 0.80, RMSE = 27.6 Mg C ha-1). This model is comparable in predictive
	power to locally calibrated models, but relies on limited inputs
	of basal area and wood density information for a given region, rather
	than on traditional plot inventories. With this approach, we propose
	to radically decrease the time required to calibrate airborne LiDAR
	data and thus increase the output of high-resolution carbon maps,
	supporting tropical forest conservation and climate mitigation policy.},

	The mathematical model is a set of coupled ordinary differential

	a global model governing the time variation of the total numbers

	comparison with local interactions. The spatial aggregation allows
	us again to obtain an O.D.E. governing the total population density,
	which is obtained by integration all over the spatial domain, at
	the slow time scale. These aggregations of variables are based on
	time scales separation methods which have been presented largely

	growth of the population. It is shown that, in a constant game matrix,
	the population grows according to a logistic curve whose r and K

	to domestic cat populations for which the behavior of individuals

	approach that considers the community's complexity in terms of groups
	of species coherently varied in space or time is proposed. For a
	given set of samples, the number of such groups is related to the
	minimal number M of axes necessary to represent the original configuration
	of the data set. I interpret this ?minimal dimensionality of structure?
	as the number of independent factors of structural variability and
	its normalized value M/MMAX as a measure of the organizational complexity
	of a community. The M value can be estimated as the number of significant
	axes obtained by ordination procedures. The percentage of total variance
	explained by these axes, T, is used as measure of structural rigidity.
	This approach is applied to data on the multi-scaled spatial distribution
	of marine benthic ciliates and macrofauna. Both the M and the T values
	obtained by principal component analysis show significant scale-dependence
	with an evident threshold at some critical area, with values of zero
	below this threshold, then increasing sharply as the area extends
	beyond the threshold. The critical scale of community organization
	ranges from hundreds of meters to kilometers for macroorganisms,

  abstract = {This book discusses the interplay of diffusion processes and partial

	in PDE. It begins with stochastic differential equations, the probabilistic
	machinery needed to study PDE. After spending three chapters on probabilistic
	representations of solutions for PDE, regularity of solutions and
	one dimensional diffusions, the author discusses in depth two main
	types of second order linear differential operators: non-divergence
	operators and divergence operators, including topics such as the
	Harnack inequality of Krylov-Safonov for non-divergence operators
	and heat kernel estimates for divergence form operators. Martingale
	problems and the Malliavin calculus are presented in two other chapters.
	This book can be used as a textbook for a graduate course on diffusion
	theory with applications to PDE. It will also be a valuable reference
	to researchers in probability who are interested in PDE as well as
	for analysts who are interested in probabilistic methods. Richard
	F. Bass is Professor of Mathematics at the University of Washington.
	He has written many research papers on the topics covered by this

	four hypotheses of the persistence of this shade-tolerant species
	in hurricane-frequented forests (resistance, recovery, release, and
	complementation). Although growth and mortality schedules changed
	as a result of the hurricane, the asymptotic population growth rate
	did not change significantly and did not depart significantly from
	$\lambda=1$ (stability) in either the pre- or the posthurricane periods.
	Long-term trends simulated for varying hurricane frequencies also
	projected stability in population size. These results supported the
	resistance hypothesis. Elasticity analysis showed that, while recruitment
	had a minor influence, survival of medium-sized trees was the most
	critical character influencing population growth. Similar patterns
	of life history sensitivity are common among other trees, suggesting
	that traits related to survival of large understory individuals would
	often be under high selection pressure. Among these traits, those
	associated with hurricane resistance could also be advantageous in
	forests subjected to light to moderate disturbance. Thus, resistance
	to canopy disruption could have remained linked to shade tolerance
	during expansions and contractions of the distribution of F. grandifolia.},

	Viability Analysis (PVA) with endangered species. We review the structure,
	data requirements, and outputs of analytical, deterministic single-population,
	stochastic single-population, metapopulation, and spatially explicit
	models. We believe predictions from quantitative models for endangered
	species are unreliable due to poor quality of demographic data used
	in most applications, difficulties in estimating variance in demographic
	rates, and lack of information on dispersal (distances, ages, mortality,
	movement patterns). Unreliable estimates also arise because stochastic
	models are difficult to validate, environmental trends and periodic
	fluctuations are rarely considered, the form of density dependence
	is frequently unknown but greatly affects model outcomes, and alternative
	model structures can result in very different predicted effects of
	management regimes. We suggest that PVA (1) evaluate relative rather
	than absolute rates of extinction, (2) emphasize short-time periods
	for making projections, (3) start with simple models and choose an
	approach that data can support, (4) use models cautiously to diagnose
	causes of decline and examine potential routes to recovery, (5) evaluate
	cumulative ending functions and alternative reference points rather
	than extinction rates, (6) examine all feasible scenarios, and (7)
	mix genetic and demographic currencies sparingly. Links between recovery
	options and PVA models should be established by conducting field
	tests of model assumptions and field validation of secondary model

	model are described in order to characterize the diversity of neutral
	communities of ecologically equivalent species. Diversity is described
	by species number S and the variance of frequency or log abundance
	q. The frequency distribution of abundance is very generally lognormal,
	skewed to the left by immigration and resembling descriptions of
	natural communities. Increased immigration and community size always
	cause S to increase. Their effect on q is more complicated, but given
	biologically reasonable assumptions, S and q will be positively correlated
	in most circumstances. Larger samples contain more species; the graph
	of log S on log individuals, equivalent to a species-area curve,
	is generally convex upward but becomes linear with a slope of about
	+0.25 when immigration is low and births exceed deaths. When individuals
	invade a new, vacant environment, both S and q increase through time.
	Thus, a positive correlation between S and q will usually be generated
	when sites of differing size or age are surveyed. At equilibrium,
	communities maintain roughly constant levels of S and q but change
	in composition through time; composition may remain similar, however,
	for many generations. Many prominent patterns observed in natural
	communities can therefore be generated by a strictly neutral model.
	This does not show that community structure is determined exclusively
	by demographic stochasticity, but rather demonstrates the necessity
	for an appropriate null model when functional hypotheses are being
	tested.},

	productivity, soil properties, and microclimate in a moderately mesic
	savanna (c. 750 mm annual rainfall) were investigated and compared
	with an earlier study of the effects of the same two species in a
	more xeric savanna (c. 450 mm annual rainfall) in Tsavo National
	Park (West), Kenya. 2. Similar to the more xeric site, solar radiation
	was reduced by 45-65% and soil temperatures were reduced by 5 - 12oC
	under both tree species. Except for early in the growing season,
	soil-moisture values were similar under tree canopies and in open
	grasslands. 3. Compared to the more xeric site, where herbaceous-layer
	productivity was 95% higher under trees than in the open, productivity
	in the mesic site was 52% higher under acacia canopies (a mean of
	808 g m-2) than in the open (533 g m-2), but only 18% higher under
	baobab canopies (569 g m-2) than in the open (484 g m-2). 4. Concentrations
	of organic matter, total N, N-15, P, K and Ca were significantly
	higher, and C:N ratios and soil bulk density significantly lower
	under tree canopies than in the open at both sites. Mg concentrations
	were significantly higher in the open than under tree canopies at
	the mesic, but not the xeric, site. 5. The contrast noted in 3 above
	between the herbaceous layer productivity below tree canopies and
	that in areas beyond them was attributed higher soil-N concentrations
	and to reduced evapotranspiration in these N- and water-limited systems.
	6. The contrast in forage production under tree canopies between
	xeric and mesic sites may be due to the greater importance of shade
	in reducing temperatures and evapotranspiration in more arid environments.}

  abstract = {As both spatial and temporal characteristics of desired future conditions
	are becoming important measures of forest plan success, forest plans
	and forest planning goals are becoming complex. Heuristic techniques
	are becoming popular for developing alternative forest plans that
	include spatial constraints. Eight types of heuristic planning techniques
	were applied to three increasingly difficult forest planning problems
	where the objective function sought to maximize the amount of land
	in certain types of wildlife habitat. The goal of this research was
	to understand the relative challenges and opportunities each technique
	presents when more complex difficult goals are desired. The eight
	heuristic techniques were random search, simulated annealing, great
	deluge, threshold accepting, tabu search with 1-opt moves, tabu search
	with 1-opt and 2-opt moves, genetic algorithm, and a hybrid tabu
	search / genetic algorithm search process. While our results should
	not be viewed as universal truths, we determined that for the problems
	we examined, there were three classes of techniques: very good (simulated
	annealing, threshold accepting, great deluge, tabu search with 1-opt
	and 2-opt moves, and tabu search / genetic algorithm), adequate (tabu
	search with 1-opt moves, genetic algorithm), and less than adequate
	(random search). The relative advantages in terms of solution time
	and complexity of programming code are discussed and should provide
	planners and researchers a guide to help match the appropriate technique
	to their planning problem. The hypothetical landscape model used
	to evaluate the techniques can also be used by others to further
	compare their techniques to the ones described here.},

  abstract = {Understanding mechanisms to predict changes in plant and animal communities
	is a key challenge in ecology. The need to transfer knowledge gained
	from single species to a more generalized approach has led to the
	development of categorization systems where species? similarities
	in life strategies and traits are classified into ecological groups
	(EGs) like functional groups/types or guilds. While approaches in
	plant ecology undergo a steady improvement and refinement of methodologies,
	progression in animal ecology is lagging behind. With this review,
	we aim to initiate a further development of functional classification
	systems in animal ecology, comparable to recent developments in plant
	ecology. We here (i) give an overview of terms and definitions of
	EGs in animal ecology, (ii) discuss existing classification systems,
	methods and application areas of EGs (focusing on terrestrial vertebrates),
	and (iii) provide a ?roadmap towards an animal functional type approach?
	for improving the application of EGs and classifications in animal
	ecology. We found that an animal functional type approach requires:
	(i) the identification of core traits describing species? dependency
	on their habitat and life history traits, (ii) an optimization of
	trait selection by clustering traits into hierarchies, (iii) the
	assessment of ?soft traits? as substitute for hardly measurable traits,
	e.g. body size for dispersal ability, and (iv) testing of delineated
	groups for validation including experiments.},

	ans en moyenne et situ\'es \`a proximit\'e l'un de l'autre, dans

	$T(F_n) - T(F)$, we adapt the differential approach of von Mises
	(1947) to exploit stochastic properties of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
	distance $\sup_x|F_n(x) - F(x)|$. This leads directly to the central
	limit theorem (CLT) and law of the iterated logarithm (LIL) for $T(F_n)
	- T(F)$. The adaptation also incorporates innovations designed to
	broaden the scope of statistical application of the concept of differential.
	Application to a wide class of robust-type $M$-estimates is carried
	out.}

	abundance distributions collected at different spatial scales may
	collapse into a single curve after appropriate renormalization, and
	second, the power-law form of the species-area relationship and the
	Shannon, Simpson, and Berger-Parker diversity indices belong to a
	family of equations relating the species number, species abundance,
	and area through the moments of the species abundance?probability
	density function. Explicit formulas for these diversity indices,
	as a function of area, are derived. Methods to obtain the multifractal
	spectra from a data set are discussed, and an example is shown with
	data on tree and shrub species collected in a 50-ha plot on Barro
	Colorado Island, Panama. Finally, we discuss the implications of
	the multifractal formalism to the relationship between species range
	and abundance and the relation between the shape of the species abundance
	distribution and area.},

	to the boreal and deciduous forests. The results show that FORCLIM
	provides plausible species compositions along this gradient; most
	of the divergences concern species that are of minor abundance. In
	the central part of the gradient, the simulated species composition
	is considerably more realistic than the one obtained in an earlier

	boreal forest the bahaviour of some light-demanding species is anomalous.
	Along drought gradients in the south western part of the gradient,
	FORCLIM misrepresents the influence of increased drought on forest
	structure, thus pointing to further research needs. The results are
	discussed within the context of model verification, the applicability
	of FORCLIM to study climatic change issues and the evolution of different
	tree species on the two continents. Prospects are outlined for developing
	a forest gap model that is applicable over a wide range of environmental

  abstract = {Modelling masting habit, i.e. the spatial synchronized annual variability
	in fruit production, is a huge task due to two main circumstances:
	(1) the identification of main ecological factors controlling fruiting
	processes, and (2) the common departure of fruit data series from
	the main basic statistical assumptions of normality and independence.
	Stone pine (Pinus pinea L.) is one of the main species in the Mediterranean
	basin that is able to grow under hard limiting conditions (sandy
	soils and extreme continental climate), and typically defined as
	a masting species. Considering the high economical value associated
	with edible nut production, the masting habit of stone pine has been
	a main concern for the forest management of the species. In the present
	work we have used annual fruit data series from 740 stone pine trees
	measured during a 13 years period (1996?2008) in order: (a) to verify
	our main hypothesis pointing out to the existence of a weather control
	of the fruiting process in limiting environments, rather than resource
	depletion or endogenous inherent cycles; (b) to identify those site
	factors, stand attributes and climate events affecting specific traits
	involved in fruiting process; and (c) to construct a model for predicting
	spatial and temporal patterns of variability in stone pine cone production
	at different spatial extents as region, stand and tree. Given the
	nature of the data, the model has been formulated as zero-inflated
	log-normal, incorporating random components to carry out with the
	observed lack of independence. This model attains efficiencies close
	to 70?80% in predicting temporal and spatial variability at regional
	scale. Though efficiencies are reduced according to the spatial extent
	of the model, it leads to unbiased estimates and efficiencies over
	35?50% when predicting annual yields at tree or stand scale, respectively.
	In this sense, the proposed model is a main tool for facilitating
	decision making in some management aspects such as the quantification
	of total amount of cones annually supplied to nut industry, design
	of cone harvest programs or the optimal application of seedling felling.},

  abstract = {The relation of community structure to community function is the subject
	of much ecological theorizing. Three approaches to the problem, based
	on cybernetics, control theory, and niche theory, can be identified.
	They concur in giving biological interactions a major role in the
	determination of community structure in general, and species diversity
	in particular. To examine this body of theory, I use a "neutral"
	model for community development, a model which eliminates completely
	the biological interactions in question. Comparison of the patterns
	of community structure resulting from this model with the structure
	of natural communities provides an estimate of the effect of the
	biotic interactions. This can then be compared to the theoretically
	predicted effects. The neutral model used was originally developed
	in population genetics. In the context in which it is used here,
	it describes the stochastic development of a set of noninteracting
	populations, which colonize a community, persist temporarily, and
	eventually become extinct. The model predicts the form of the distribution
	of relative abundances and of species area curves, and sample values
	of species diversity. Comparisons of the model's predictions with
	actual community structure are made across what are taken to be gradients
	in the importance of biological interaction (successional vs. climax
	communities, high variation vs. low variation environments, the temperate
	zone vs. the tropics), using data on birds, fish, trees and insects.
	The results clearly contradict some of the theories of community
	structure. In those situations where biological interactions are
	predicted to generate the greatest increase in species diversity,
	the neutral model analysis shows that diversity is in fact significantly
	lower than would be expected in the absence of such interactions.
	Some implications of these findings for community theory are discussed.},

  volume = {8},
  pages = {1226-1238},
  number = {4},
  abstract = {The harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) in the western North Atlantic
	is subject to mortality due to entanglement in gillnets. Such incidental
	mortality threatens a population if it is too large relative to the
	potential population growth rate. Critical values for incidental
	mortality have been established by the International Whaling Commission
	and the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act. As in many situations
	in conservation biology, use of these critical values depends on
	demographic calculations that are based on uncertain data. It is
	important to report not only estimates of demographic parameters,
	but also the uncertainty in those estimates. Here, we use a Monte
	Carlo approach to evaluate uncertainty in population size, incidental
	mortality, and population growth rate of harbor porpoise. To describe
	survival, we used model life tables derived from other mammals with
	similar life histories. By randomly sampling the space of model life
	tables and the distributions of estimated fertility and age at first
	reproduction, we produced a probability distribution that characterizes
	the uncertainty in the potential population growth rate. The median
	estimate for the potential annual rate of increase $\lambda$ is approximately
	1.10. Combining this information with the uncertainty of incidental
	mortality and of population size, we estimate the probability that
	the rate of incidental mortality exceeds the critical values established
	by the various management agencies; this probability ranges from
	0.46 to 0.94. We conclude that recent incidental mortality rates
	are a threat to harbor porpoise populations. The methods developed
	here are applicable to other situations in which demographic analyses
	must be based on uncertain data.},

	The TRAC was recently developed to quantify the effect of canopy
	architecture on optical measurements of leaf area index. The stands
	were located on georeferenced Landsat TM images using global positioning
	system (GPS) measurements. It is found that late spring Landsat images
	are superior to summer images for determining overstory LAI in boreal
	conifer stands because the effect of the understory is minimized
	in the spring before the full growth of the understory and moss cover.
	The effective LAI, obtained from gap fraction measurements assuming
	a random distribution of foliage spatial positions, was found to
	be better correlated to SR and NDVI than LAI. The effective LAI is
	less variable and easier to measure than LAI, and is also an intrinsic
	attribute of plant canopies. It is therefore suggested to use effective
	LAI as the most important parameter for radiation interception considerations.},

  volume = {10},
  pages = {52-68},
  abstract = {Scale transition theory is an approach to understanding population
	and community dynamics in the presence of spatial or temporal variation
	in environmental factors or population densities. It focuses on changes
	in the equations for population dynamics as the scale enlarges. These
	changes are explained in terms of interactions between nonlinearities
	and variation on lower scales, and they predict the emergence of
	new properties on larger scales that are not predicted by lower scale
	dynamics in the absence of variation on those lower scales. These
	phenomena can be understood in terms of statistical inequalities
	arising from the process of nonlinear averaging, which translates
	the rules for dynamics from lower to higher scales. Nonlinearities
	in population dynamics are expressions of the fundamental biology
	of the interactions between individual organisms. Variation that
	interacts with these nonlinearities also involves biology fundamentally
	in several different ways. First, there are the aspects of biology
	that are sensitive to variation in space or time. These determine
	which aspects of a nonlinear dynamical equation are affected by variation,
	and whether different individuals or different species are sensitive
	to different extents or to different aspects of variation. Second
	is the nature of the variation, for example, whether it is variation
	in the physical environment or variation in population densities.
	From the interplay between variation and nonlinearities in population
	dynamics, scale transition theory builds a theory of changes in dynamics
	with changes in scale. In this article, the focus is on spatial variation,
	and the theory is illustrated with examples relevant to the dynamics
	of insect communities. In these communities, one commonly occurring
	nonlinear relationship is a negative exponential relationship between
	survival of an organism and the densities of natural enemies or competitors.
	This negative exponential has a biological origin in terms of independent
	actions of many individuals. The subsequent effects of spatial variation
	can be represented naturally in terms of Laplace transforms and related
	statistical transforms to obtain both analytical solutions and an
	extra level of understanding. This process allows us to analyze the
	meaning and effects of aggregation of insects in space. Scale transition
	theory more generally, however, does not aim to have fully analytical
	solutions but partial analytical solutions applicable for circumstances
	too complex for full analytical solution. These partial solutions
	are intended to provide a framework for understanding of numerical
	solutions, simulations and field studies where key quantities can
	be estimated from empirical data.},

	automaton model by simulating the behaviour of distinct plant functional
	types. 2. Types differed according to three fundamental traits: size
	of plant modules; longevity of modules in the absence of resources;
	and propensity to flowering. 3. When expressed at three levels apiece,
	the three traits were able to approximate the essential biology of
	seven important types within a well known system of plant functional
	types (the C-S-R system, based on disturbance and resource availability).
	4. The seven types, when grown in real experiments with virtual communities,
	reproduced classical community-level behaviour to the extent of demonstrating
	smooth, competitive replacements along gradients of resource or disturbance,
	or both. 5. In complex communities simulated over a wide range of
	environmental conditions, the seven types produced a clearly ?humpbacked?
	curve linking plant diversity to community productivity. The mixtures
	of species resulting from these experiments together represented
	all parts of C-S-R space. 6. These outcomes emerged solely from the
	?bottom-up? processes inherent in self-assembling cellular automata.
	No community-level specifications were inserted into the model, yet
	the community-level consequences agreed with both the underlying
	predictions of C-S-R theory and field observations. 7. This work
	confirms that the dynamics of herbaceous plant communities can be
	emergent from the resource-handling properties of the organs of the
	constituent species, and that a simple rule base can, to a first
	approximation, be sufficient to reproduce such dynamics.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims Forest tree saplings that grow in the understorey
	undergo frequent changes in their light environment to which they
	must adapt to ensure their survival and growth. Crown architecture,
	which plays a critical role in light capture and mechanical stability,
	is a major component of sapling adaptation to canopy disturbance.
	Shade-adapted saplings typically have plagiotropic stems and branches.
	After canopy opening, they need to develop more erect shoots in order
	to exploit the new light conditions. The objective of this study
	was to test whether changes in sapling stem inclination occur after
	canopy opening, and to analyse the morphological changes associated
	with stem reorientation. Methods A 4-year canopy-opening field experiment
	with naturally regenerated Fagus sylvatica and Acer pseudoplatanus
	saplings was conducted. The appearance of new stem axes, stem basal
	diameter and inclination along the stem were recorded every year
	after canopy opening. Key Results Both species showed considerable
	stem reorientation resulting primarily from uprighting (more erect)
	shoot movements in Fagus, and from uprighting movements, shoot elongation
	and formation of relay shoots in Acer. In both species, the magnitude
	of shoot uprighting movements was primarily related to initial stem
	inclination. Both the basal part and the apical part of the stem
	contributed to uprighting movements. Stem movements did not appear
	to be limited by stem size or by stem growth. Conclusions Stem uprighting
	movements in shade-adapted Fagus and Acer saplings following canopy
	disturbance were considerable and rapid, suggesting that stem reorientation
	processes play a significant role in the growth strategy of the species.},

	their early stages. All other species (Quercus sp., Fraxinus excelsior,
	Carpinus betulus, Acer campestre, Acer platano\"{\i}des, Sorbus torminalis,
	Tilia sp.) were either absent from the regeneration or completely
	over-topped by the two dominant species. These features were ascribed
	to a regime of periodic natural or anthropic disturbance of intermediate
	intensity, where small gaps are regularly created in the canopy.
	This regime results in a succession of short, open and closed canopy
	episodes that eventually promote shade-tolerant species. During this
	regime, the shade-tolerant species are able to build a strong advance
	regeneration that is ready to outgrow the other species when gaps
	are created. If the management objective is to maintain species diversity
	during the regeneration process, the development of this advance
	regeneration will have to be strictly controlled.}

  abstract = {In the Pacific northwestern (PNW) region of North America, climatic
	conditions have significantly warmed since a predominantly cool phase
	of the Pacific North American circulation patterns between 1950 and
	1975. What are the implications of this shift in climate for the
	vulnerability of native tree species? To address this question, we
	combined mechanistic and statistical models to assess where a variety
	of native tree species might be more vulnerable within their recorded
	ranges and where they might potentially migrate. For long-lived species
	that are well adapted to compete, seasonal differences in photosynthesis
	and water use offer insights helpful in predicting their distributions.
	To evaluate the general response of conifers to climatic variation
	across the region, we previously applied a process-based model (3-PG),
	to simulate the growth and maximum leaf area index that Douglas-fir
	could attain within recognized forested areas. We then constructed
	automated decision tree models to define and map the ecological distributions
	of 15 tree species based on differences in how photosynthesis was
	constrained by drought, daytime temperatures, high evaporative demand,
	and the frequency of frost. For the baseline climate period (1950?1975),
	the decision tree models predicted presence and absence of each species
	at not, vert, similar23,000 observations with an average accuracy
	of 81%, with an average kappa statistic of 0.74. In this paper the
	same models were run annually for the period between 1976 and 2006
	for each species, and the areas defined as remaining suitable or
	becoming vulnerable to disturbance were identified based on whether
	more or less than half of the years fell within the originally defined
	limits. Based on these criteria, 70% of the species recorded ranges
	remained suitable, with 30% deemed vulnerable. Results varied notably
	by species with western red cedar and western hemlock remaining highly
	adapted, with potential for range expansion in area of up to 50%
	relative to the baseline period. In contrast, ponderosa pine, lodgepole
	pine, grand, and noble fir were classified as vulnerable with potential
	net contractions in their ranges. The analysis was extended through
	the rest of the 21st century using climatic projections from the
	Canadian global circulation model with a high fossil fuel emission
	scenario (A2) and compared to other previously published species
	range predictions.},

  abstract = {Broad ecosystem based classifications are increasingly applied as
	a context to consider, understand, and manage biodiversity. The need
	for more spatially explicit, repeatable, transferable, transparent,
	and defensible environmental regionalization has become apparent.
	Increased computing power, sophisticated analysis software, and the
	availability of spatially explicit descriptions of the environment,
	principally derived from Earth observation data, have facilitated
	the development of statistical ecosystem regionalizations. These
	regionalizations are desired to produce environmentally unique ecoregions
	to provide the basis for stratification for ongoing biodiversity
	monitoring efforts. Using a suite of indicators of the physical environment,
	available energy such as vegetation production, and habitat suitability
	all derived from remote sensing technology at 1 km spatial resolution,
	we undertook an environmental regionalization using a two-stage multivariate
	classification of terrestrial Canada. A relatively large number of
	classes were initially derived (100) and a hierarchical clustering
	approach was then applied to derive a 40 level classification. These
	clusters where then used to assess which clusters were the most dissimilar
	to the majority thus providing indication of the most unique environmental
	domains across Canada. Secondly, a 14 class stratification was then
	produced to emulate the current ecozone stratification commonly used
	in Canada. Results indicated that a number of unique clusters exits
	across Canada, specifically the forest/urban-industrial/cropland
	mosaic in the southern portion of Ontario, the mixed wood forests
	in south?central Ontario and western Quebec, the foothills of south
	western Alberta, regions of the southern Arctic and the northern
	Boreal shield (particularly the areas south of Hudson Bay and Labrador).
	A resemblance between the 14 class stratification and the ecozone
	classification for Canada is evident; locations of within and between
	ecozone heterogeneity are also indicated. A critical key benefit
	of utilising ecoregions quantitatively using key indicators, such
	as those derived from remote sensing observations, is the capacity
	to establish, and quantify, how well particular networks of sites,
	or plot locations, represent the overall environment. As such, the
	incorporation of these types of methods, and remotely derived indicators,
	into biodiversity assessment is an important area of ongoing research.},

	feasible for field systems. Despite this, population-level observational
	studies play a critical role in biology. For example, they have revealed
	how environmental change generates ecological and evolutionary change
	in free-living populations. When replicated experiments are impossible,
	constructing models and using these to conduct in silico experiments
	is the next best thing. Recent advances in the construction and analysis
	of integral projection models (IPMs) mean they offer a remarkably
	powerful tool to study ecological and evolutionary dynamics. IPMs
	can be parameterised using data frequently collected by ecologists,
	but the ease with which they can be constructed and analysed is perhaps
	not as widely appreciated as it could be. In this paper, which is
	loosely related to the talk I gave when receiving the Per Brinck
	Oikos Award in 2012, I show how easily IPMs can be constructed and
	analysed, and I argue they play an important role in posing and testing
	hypotheses in population biology.},

  abstract = {Highland forests in Ethiopia are essential socially, economically,
	ecologically and for their cultural and symbolic value. However they
	suffered degradation for thousands of years, with an exponential
	increase since the middle of the XXth century. Nowadays there is
	need and will for sustainable management of the remaining woodlands
	and for restoration of the degraded ones. Dominant indigenous species
	of these dry afromontane forests, like Juniperus procera, deserve
	paramount attention for this purpose. We studied the growth and population
	dynamics of this species in the Adaba-Dodola Forest Priority Area,
	south of the country. From an inventory we assessed the present status
	of Juniperus procera in the Adaba-Dodola forest. Then we evaluated
	the dendrochronological potential of the species. Eventually, from
	these two investigations we built a matrix model, to project the
	evolution of the juniper population into the future and gain indications
	for a sustainable forest use. We found two juniper population types
	in the study area, without being able to explain this difference.
	Juniperus procera forms annual growth layers in response to precipitation.
	Apparently it also grows in response to intra-annual precipitation
	variations and expresses it anatomically by variations in cell-wall
	density. Matrix-model output was not influenced by small methodological
	changes, but its interpretation remains delicate. This limitation
	can be avoided by a qualitative and quantitative improvement of the
	input data. Nevertheless, for wood supply we recommend the use of
	big and fully-grown trees from the second population type that we
	pointed out, instead of adult sound junipers.},

  abstract = {The possible responses of ecosystem processes to rising atmospheric
	CO2 concentration and climate change are illustrated using six dynamic
	global vegetation models that explicitly represent the interactions
	of ecosystem carbon and water exchanges with vegetation dynamics.
	The models are driven by the IPCC IS92a scenario of rising CO2 (Wigley
	et al. 1991), and by climate changes resulting from effective CO2
	concentrations corresponding to IS92a, simulated by the coupled ocean
	atmosphere model HadCM2-SUL. Simulations with changing CO2 alone
	show a widely distributed terrestrial carbon sink of 1.4?3.8 Pg C
	y-1 during the 1990s, rising to 3.7?8.6 Pg C y-1 a century later.
	Simulations including climate change show a reduced sink both today
	(0.6?3.0 Pg C y-1) and a century later (0.3?6.6 Pg C y-1) as a result
	of the impacts of climate change on NEP of tropical and southern
	hemisphere ecosystems. In all models, the rate of increase of NEP
	begins to level off around 2030 as a consequence of the ?diminishing
	return? of physiological CO2 effects at high CO2 concentrations.
	Four out of the six models show a further, climate-induced decline
	in NEP resulting from increased heterotrophic respiration and declining
	tropical NPP after 2050. Changes in vegetation structure influence
	the magnitude and spatial pattern of the carbon sink and, in combination
	with changing climate, also freshwater availability (runoff). It
	is shown that these changes, once set in motion, would continue to
	evolve for at least a century even if atmospheric CO2 concentration
	and climate could be instantaneously stabilized. The results should
	be considered illustrative in the sense that the choice of CO2 concentration
	scenario was arbitrary and only one climate model scenario was used.
	However, the results serve to indicate a range of possible biospheric
	responses to CO2 and climate change. They reveal major uncertainties
	about the response of NEP to climate change resulting, primarily,
	from differences in the way that modelled global NPP responds to
	a changing climate. The simulations illustrate, however, that the
	magnitude of possible biospheric influences on the carbon balance
	requires that this factor is taken into account for future scenarios
	of atmospheric CO2 and climate change.},

	models can be difficult due to low mortality rates coupled with typically

	(GA) for inverse parameter estimation of a tropical palm (Mauritia
	flexuosa) matrix population model. The palm matrix model, with six
	size classes above 1 m height, simulates a density-dependent mono-dominant
	population. The population was sampled during 1994 through 1996,
	and is believed to be at steady-state. The previously published parameter
	values poorly predict the observed steady-state size class distribution.
	We found that GA optimization led to greatly improved fits with mean
	errors of less than one individual per size class. However, repeating
	the GA optimization 15 times demonstrated a lack of consistency in
	the magnitudes of optimal demographic parameters, with some parameters
	far outside the range of estimates from five measurement plots. An
	additional set of GA optimizations, constrained to keep 13 parameters
	within the plot-to-plot variation, also had excellent fits, but was
	much more consistent. This consistent pattern demonstrates that the
	observed size class distribution is a plausible result of the hypothesized
	model and the parameter space bounded by measurements. The pattern
	of optimal parameter estimates in the constrained GA optimization
	set supports the hypothesis that juvenile palms (6-20 m height) grow
	rapidly into the reproductive size classes, and that this rapid growth
	was underestimated in the field sampling.},

  abstract = {A central challenge in ecology is understanding the emergence of broad-scale
	community and ecosystem patterns as the result of interactions among
	individuals. We identify the role of fine-scale light heterogeneity
	in controlling broad-scale community behavior in SORTIE, an empirically
	derived, stochastic forest simulation model. SORTIE employs a very
	detailed measure of local light based on a 216-point sample around
	every tree. We test the importance of this fine-scale description
	of local light by reformulating SORTIE with less detail in this algorithm.
	Predicted forests are compared at several scales from total tree
	biomass (coarse grained) and patterns of forest succession to the
	local spatial pattern of light availability at the forest floor (fine
	grained). SORTIE is surprisingly insensitive to the amount of detail
	used in the calculation of the local resource, light. In all simulations,
	48- and 16-point samples accurately reproduce the local light environment
	and thus predict forest development without appreciable error. A
	one-point sample of light significantly alters the estimates of the
	local light environment, but the emergent forest dynamics are insensitive
	to these alterations. The robustness of the forest model to the altered
	light environment stems from two very different mechanisms. First,
	the alterations of the light environment have very short correlation
	lengths in time and space. This allows fine-scale averaging to occur
	on the landscape. Second, the functional relationships among light
	availability, growth rate, and mortality risk in several key species
	tend to prevent the altered light environment from affecting individual
	tree performance. These results demonstrate that emergent forest
	dynamics in SORTIE do not require detailed local light estimation
	to capture the interaction between local resource heterogeneity and
	the functional responses of trees. In addition, we have shown that
	comparing model predictions at several scales provides a strong methodology
	to identify relevant detail and understand scaling in this model
	of a forest.},

	A method is proposed by which to incorporate the data from different

	between molecular and morphological distances appears to be triangular,
	molecular divergence behaving as a limiting factor for morphological

  abstract = {The desert tortoise is a threatened species living in the deserts
	of the American Southwest. Using size?structured demographic models,
	we analyzed the status of the tortoise in the Western Mojave desert
	and evaluated the effectiveness of possible management measures.
	Our demographic analyses agree with the trends reported by field
	censuses in showing rapid population decline. Importantly, simulations
	that include variation and correlation in vital rates yield highly
	variable forecasts of population growth, indicating the uncertainties
	inherent in even short-term projections of tortoise population sizes.
	To determine where conservation efforts and data collection should
	be focused, we performed a series of sensitivity analyses in which
	the effects of changing different vital rates were quantified. We
	found that the rate of population growth is most sensitive to the
	survival of large adult females and that improving survival of this
	size class to reputably "pristine" rates could reverse population
	declines; in contrast, large improvements in other vital rates will
	not, alone, reverse population decline. Thus, shooting, off-road
	vehicles, upper respiratory tract disease (URTD), and other major
	sources of adult mortality should be the primary focus of management
	strategies. Finally, we discuss the impact of the proposed expansion
	of the U.S. Army's Fort Irwin, which would reduce the Western Mojave
	tortoise population by $\leq$ 13%. We argue that the expansion could
	have a grave impact on the long-term population viability of the
	tortoise, but that this impact will be a function of the management
	of remaining tortoise habitat. We conclude that, although many anthropogenic
	impacts threaten the tortoise, the species' future could be bright,
	provided that research and land-use planning focus on biologically
	important aspects of its life history.},

  abstract = {1. The situation, geology and general climate of Budongo forest are
	described. The mean annual rainfall on the edge of the forest is
	about 1500 mm. (59 in.). 2. Brief mention is made of the main biotic
	factors affecting the area. Until recently man has had a negligible
	influence on the forest, but elephant and fire play a major part
	in controlling development. 3. The forest is comparatively young.
	Although it is spreading it is unable to colonize pure stands of
	elephant grass. 4. The least advanced type of closed forest at Budongo
	is Colonizing Forest, in which one associes and one consocies are
	recognized. Colonizing Forest is succeeded by Mixed Forest and Mixed
	Forest is succeeded by Ironwood Forest, which is the climatic climax.
	Swamp Forest is regarded as an edaphic climax. Both climates are
	consociations. 5. An account is given of the methods used to investigate
	the forest. Floristic composition was studied in eleven sample plots
	each 122 m. (400 ft.) square. Structure is illustrated by means of
	profile diagrams constructed from data from clear-felled plots. 6.
	Colonizing Forest is shown to be two-storied, Mixed Forest four-storied
	and Ironwood Forest three-storied. The stratification of Ironwood
	Forest and of Mixed Forest differ only in the fact that in Ironwood
	Forest the topmost (emergent) layer is composed almost entirely of
	the same tree (Cynometra alexandri C. H. Wright) which dominates
	the main canopy. In Mixed Forest the two top layers are composed
	of different species. 7. Shrub and herb strata are described. Climbers,
	epiphytes, parasites and saprophytes are discussed. 8. A description
	of the forest types is followed by a comparison of Budongo with other
	forests in Uganda and with rain forests elsewhere in the tropics.
	The climax type at Budongo is shown to have a close general similarity
	with consociations described from British Guiana, although fewer
	understory species are present.},

	single species populations, and a similar transition matrix model
	to communities of more than one species. Examples are drawn from
	populations of Araucaria spp. in tropical rainforest in Papua New
	Guinea, and from Nothofagus fusca stands in temperate montane forest
	in New Zealand. Both species generally had ? values close to 1.0
	(r, the intrinsic rate of natural increase ? 0) and in both cases
	predicted trends were consistent with other ecological information
	from the stands or elsewhere. Various possible sources of error and
	empirical tests of the sensitivity of the single species model and
	the accuracy of its predictions are described. It is concluded that,
	despite certain limitations, with careful interpretation these models
	constitute an important tool for the investigation of forest dynamics.
	The basic model may be modified in various ways, for example, to
	include vegetative reproduction, or put to use in practical problems
	such as defining a harvesting strategy for a forest tree species.
	In studies of succession involving long-lived species these models
	are particularly valuable, not only for predicting the magnitude
	and direction of future changes, but also because they suggest a
	time scale for the trends, and this can then be evaluated in the
	light of other knowledge about the communities in question. Moreover,
	the variability of ? values obtained for differen species relates
	to their life cycle strategies, so that by the use of Leslie matrices
	it may be possible objectively to rank the species of a community
	along the continuum of r to k strategies.},

  abstract = {The temporal stability of estimates of demographic behaviour for a
	sample population of the tropical rainforest gymnosperm Araucaria
	cunninghamii was analysed using a stage-classified (Lefkovitch) matrix
	model. Previously published life-table analyses, which used only
	2 years of held data (1975?77), were compared with life-table analysis
	based on a further 5 years of field data for growth and survival
	(1977?82). The new analysis calculated the finite rate of natural
	increase, ?, as 1.009 ? 0.077. This value is closer to the theoretical
	value of 1.0 for a stable population than is the value calculated
	on the basis of only 2 years of field data (1.021 ? 0.093). However,
	the two estimates are not significantly different from each other
	or from a value of 1.0. Despite the similarity of estimates for ?,
	the life-table analysis based on 5 years of data showed some marked
	differences from the earlier analysis. Revised growth and survival
	rates imply a slower progression to reproductive maturity and shorter
	reproductive life for A. cunninghamii. The predicted stable stage
	distribution (SSD) showed a better fit to the initial stage distribution
	(ISD), and bulges in the frequency distribution for large trees can
	be explained by the varying rates at which individuals grow from
	one stage to the next. The relative contributions of survival, growth
	and fecundity to the observed population growth rate (elasticity)
	remained similar for both analyses. Survival rate contributes most
	significantly to the achieved population growth rate, and this appears
	typical of long-lived plant species. However, the pattern of elasticities
	across size-classes changed for the new analysis and identified different
	critical life history stages from those recorded previously. Elasticity
	is proposed as a measure for classifying species using the competitive
	(C), stress-tolerant (S) and ruderal (R) model of plant strategies.},

  abstract = {Compatibility of a volume-taper equation system is generally defined
	to mean that volumes determined by integrating the taper curve from
	groundline to total tree height are algebraically identical to those
	obtained from the total volume or appropriate volume ratio equations.
	This constraint was applied to a previously published model as a
	boundary condition using the constant of integration resulting from
	the solution of the differential equation. Four cases are discussed
	that apply to different solutions of the differential equation. This
	set of models, all based on the same geometric assumption, makes
	a very flexible system for modeling stem taper. We fitted the resulting
	taper models and corresponding tip volume equations simultaneously
	to stem-measurement data for 23 tropical species growing on Hainan
	Island in southern China. The simplest case among the four (case
	I-a) was acceptable for some species, but for some others, a more
	general case (case II-b) was needed. We compared the results for
	the simplest and the most general cases of this system with a published
	geometric model having only a point constraint at dbh and with a
	published variable exponent taper equation. We examined how well
	each one predicted upper-stem diameters, merchantable height for
	a given upper-stem diameter, and total stem volume. Our taper models
	always had the smallest bias and standard error of estimates for
	total volume estimation. The variable exponent taper equation was
	the best for predicting upper-stem diameter and merchantable height.
	The advantages of a taper system with a geometric rationale are discussed,
	and two examples of easy extensions of our taper model are shown
	in the appendix. For. Sci. 45(1):85-100.},

  abstract = {1. A recent article published by Toledo et al. (2011b) investigates
	the effects of spatial variations in climate and soil, and of logging
	disturbance, on tree and forest growth in Bolivia. It concludes that
	climate is the strongest driver of tree and forest growth and that
	climate change may therefore have large consequences for forest productivity
	and carbon sequestration. However, serious methodological and conceptual
	discrepancies have been found that challenge these conclusions. 2.
	Because of an errant coding of ?time after logging? in the regression
	analysis, and because floristic changes induced by logging could
	not be incorporated into the analysis, the effect of logging on the
	average diameter growth is likely to have been strongly underestimated.
	3. Basal area growth was improperly calculated as basal area change,
	and it displayed surprisingly high values, even among unlogged plots.
	We hypothesize that either these plots may be actually located in
	secondary forests recovering from past logging, or measurement biases
	may have hampered the data set. 4. Regardless of climate-growth relationships
	established across these plots, any inference concerning the potential
	effects of climate change on forest growth would require a specific
	quantitative assessment. 5. Synthesis. It is critical to re-assess
	the relative weight of climate and logging disturbance as driving
	factors of tree and forest growth, and to find an explanation for
	the very high basal area increment reported among the unlogged plots.
	We provide specific recommendations for further analyses of this
	and similar data sets.},

  abstract = {In recruitment modeling, the response variable is a count and its
	distribution is often characterized by an excess number of zeros.
	As a result, standard distributions of probabilities, such as Poisson,
	are inappropriate. A common approach in forestry consists of using
	two-part conditional models. These models have two distinct components
	aimed to predicting the occurrence and abundance of recruitment,
	respectively. For such data, zero-inflated models might provide a
	more adequate framework by combining the two components into a joint
	distribution of probabilities. In this article, a conditional model
	is compared with two different zero-inflated models, namely, a zero-inflated
	Poisson (ZIP) and a zero-inflated discrete Weibull (ZIdiW) model.
	The three models were calibrated using a data set provided by permanent
	sample plots located in hardwood stands. Parsimony criteria (the
	Akaike information criterion and the Bayesian information criterion)
	and diagnostic plots were used to perform the comparison. The results
	show that the ZIdiW model has the best fit. The flexibility of the
	Weibull function and the possibility of obtaining a more parsimonious
	model are two advantages related to the use of a ZIdiW model in recruitment
	modeling.},

  abstract = {The $\hat{K}(d)$ function is a summary statistic of all plant-plant
	distances in a mapped area. It offers the potential for detecting
	both different types and scales of patterns in a single map. Two
	types of errors occur in maps of individual plants. Data management
	errors, caused by transcription errors or other mishandling, are
	large errors and apply to small numbers of plants. Measurement errors,
	caused by the mapping techniques and equipment, are small errors
	that apply to all plants. Simulation of known spatial patterns combined
	with increasing levels of both types of error showed that: (1) data
	management errors cause the spatial patterns identified by the statistical
	function $\hat{K}(d)$ to become less significant but do not cause
	a shift in scale of the identified patterns; and (2) measurement
	errors caused the spatial patterns identified by $\hat{K}(d)$ to
	become less significant and to shift to larger scales. The effects
	of measurement errors are inversely proportional to the scale of
	interaction between plants on the map. Detection of inhibition between
	points is more sensitive to measurement error than detection of clustering;
	detection of small clusters is more sensitive than detection of large
	clusters; and measurement error tends to cause an overestimation
	of clumping size. For patterns with inhibition, estimating minimum
	establishment distance is more sensitive to error than the maximum
	distance at which inhibition affects survival probability. Two examples
	of tree spatial distributions from the Wind River Canopy Crane Research
	Facility stem map data set were analyzed using the $\hat{K}(d)$ function.
	Clusters of \textit{Thuja plicata} were detected and were much larger
	than levels of mapping error identified in the data. Significant
	inhibition occurs between large (dbh $\geq$ 20 cm) trees of all species
	at a scale much greater than the level of mapping error. However,
	the minimum distance of significant inhibition (i.e., the distance
	within which neighbors are never found) was on the order of the mapping
	error. Accurate identification of inhibition may not be possible

	If assembly sequence interacts with productivity to influence diversity,
	different sequences can contribute to variation in productivity-diversity

	aquatic microbial communities at five productivity levels using four
	assembly sequences. About 30 generations after assembly, productivity-diversity
	relationships took various forms, including a positive, a hump-shaped,
	a U-shaped and a non-significant pattern, depending on assembly sequence.
	This variation resulted from idiosyncratic joint effects of assembly
	sequence, productivity and species identity on species abundances.

	The area is investigated by evaluated the temporal changes of spatial

	cover type maps from 1984 and 2007 using GIS and FRAGSTATS?. The
	quantative evidences presented here showed that there were drastic
	changes in the temporal and spatial dynamics of land use/forest cover.
	As an overall change between 1984 and 2007, there was a net decrease
	of 2.30% in total forested areas. On one hand, productive forest
	areas decreased 12,506 ha, on the other hand, degraded forest areas
	increased 14,805 ha. In examining the changes of crown closure and
	development stages of forest ecosystem during the study period, the
	forest stand area with medium crown closures increased. Regenerated
	area increased while the other development stages were left to grow
	to mature development stages in the period. These results regarding
	to crown closure and development stage showed that forest quality
	has increased but total forest areas decreased. This is partially
	due to out-migration of rural population in Rize and \c Cayeli towns.
	In terms of spatial configuration, analysis of the metrics revealed
	that landscape structure in Study area had changed substantially
	over the 23-year study period, resulting in fragmentation of the
	landscape as indicated by the large patch numbers and the smaller

	have been increasingly studied because of reports of potentially
	unsustainable harvest. Nevertheless, our understanding of how plant
	demographic response to harvest is altered by variation in ecological
	conditions, which is critical for developing realistic sustainable-use
	plans, is limited. We built matrix population models to test whether
	and how variation in ecological conditions affects population responses
	to harvest. In particular, we examined the effect of bark and foliage
	harvest on the demography of populations of African mahogany (Khaya
	senegalensis) in two contrasting ecological regions of Benin, West
	Africa. K. senegalensis bark and foliage harvest significantly reduced
	its stochastic population growth rates, but ecological differences
	between regions had a greater effect on population growth rates than
	did harvest. The effect of harvest on population growth rates (??)
	was slightly stronger in the moist than in the drier region. Life-table
	response experiments revealed that the mechanism by which harvesting
	reduced ? differed between ecological regions. Lowered stasis (persistence)
	of larger life stages lead to a reduction in ? in the drier region,
	whereas lowered growth of all life stages lowered ? in moist region.
	Potential strategies to increase population growth rates should include
	decreasing the proportion of individuals harvested, promoting harvester-owned
	plantations of African mahogany, and increasing survival and growth
	by promoting no-fire zones in gallery forests. Our results show how
	population responses to harvest of NTFP may be altered by ecological
	differences across sites and emphasize the importance of monitoring
	populations over the climatic range in which they occur to develop
	more realistic recommendations for conservation.},

	and logistic regression (standard and penalised) to analyse presence/pseudo-absence
	data for 13 tree species and evaluated the predictive performance
	(discrimination) using presence?absence data. The penalised logistic
	regression outperformed standard logistic regression and equalled
	the performance of Maxent. The penalised logistic regression may
	be considered one of the best methods to develop species distribution
	models trained with presence/pseudo-absence data, as it is comparable

	a zone-of-influence model based entirely upon competition between
	neighbouring trees. Negative skewness can be identified with the
	early stages of competition when only the largest trees compete.
	The model also generates bimodal distributions when competition is
	intense, as observed experimentally in annual plants. Further modes
	are generated as competition is increased further.}

	intact eastern Amazonian forest. An allometric regression biomass
	equation was developed to estimate the aboveground biomass of live
	lianas. This equation, together with a previously published equation
	for trees, was then used to estimate the contributions of lianas
	and trees to the total biomass of forest patches in four stature
	classes: gap (openings in the canopy of at least 25 m2 with the dominant
	vegetation < 3 m high), low (3?15 m canopy height), medium (15?25
	m canopy height), and high (> 25 m canopy height). Total stand-level
	biomass was estimated as the weighted average of the stature classes.
	In 130 ha of surveyed forest, forest stature classes were found in
	the following proportions: gap phase 8%; low stature 31%; medium
	stature 44%; and high stature 17%. Total aboveground biomass was
	found to be three times higher in high stature forest than in low.
	Liana biomass, however, showed the opposite result, being three times
	higher in low stature forest. Stand-level aboveground live biomass
	was estimated at 314 t ha-1 of which 43 t ha-1 (14%) was lianas.
	Liana leaf area index (LAI) ranged from 1.3 m m-2 in high stature
	forest to 5.3 m m-2 in low stature. Abundant lianas are generally
	interpreted as a sign of past forest disturbance. As forests throughout
	the Amazon basin are increasingly disturbed through human activities,
	it is likely that their biomass will be underestimated if the contribution
	of lianas is ignored.},

	damage to residual trees in stands that have relatively high densities
	of commercial trees. To complement existing studies, we measured
	forest damage caused by the selective harvesting of mahogany (Swietenia
	macrophylla), a very low density species in the Bosque Chimanes,
	Bolivia. Secondary damage along main roads and skid trails accounted
	for most of the damage measured in the study site. Total damage was
	low (4.39% of the study area), but results from our simulation model
	suggested that damage could be decreased by up to 25% by requiring
	main roads and skid trails to be linear. We used our simulation model
	to investigate the relationship between harvest intensity and forest
	damage. At low harvest intensities, most forest damage occurs from
	the construction of main roads. As harvest intensity increases, secondary
	damage from skid trails and tree felling comes to dominate forest
	damage. Overall, less damage will result to the forest for a given
	harvest volume if the harvest area is reduced and harvest intensity
	increased. Additional benefits to increasing harvest intensity are
	that re-entry into the logged site can be delayed, allowing the forest
	more time to recover, and regeneration of light-demanding species
	such as mahogany can be enhanced. The main impediment to increasing
	the harvest intensity in selective harvesting operations in Latin
	America is the lack of international markets for lesser known species,
	although there is some local and national demand.},

  abstract = {The rationale for stand growth modelling is often either grounded
	in a search for improved scientific understanding or in support for
	management decisions. The ultimate goal under the first task is seen
	in mechanistic models, i.e. models that represent the stand structure
	realistically and predict future growth as a function of the current
	status of the stand. Such mechanistic models tend to be over-parameterised
	with respect to the data actually available for a given stand. Calibration
	of these models may lead to non-unique representations and unreliable
	predictions. Empirical models, the second major line of growth modelling,
	typically match available data sets equally well than process-based
	models. They have less degrees of freedom, hence mitigate the problem
	of non-unique calibration results, but they employ often parameters
	without physiological or physical meaning. That is why empirical
	models cannot be extrapolated beyond the existing conditions of observations.
	Here we argue that this widespread dilemma can be overcome by using
	interactive models as an alternative approach to mechanistic models.
	Interactive models can be used at two levels: a) the interactions
	among trees of a species or ecosystem and b) the interactions between
	forest management and a stand structure, e.g. in thinning trials.
	In such a model data from a range of sources (scientific, administrative,
	empirical) can be brought into consistent growth reconstructions.
	Interactive selection among such growth reconstructions is theoretically
	more powerful than algorithmic/functional selection. It is suggested
	that growth models should hence be equipped with interactive visualization
	interfaces that can be utilized as input devices for silvicultural
	expertise. Interactive models will not affect the difficulties of
	predicting forest growth, but may be at their best in documenting
	and disseminating silvicultural competence in forestry.},

  volume = {30},
  pages = {751-777},
  number = {6},
  abstract = {Potential impacts of projected climate change on biodiversity are
	often assessed using single-species bioclimatic ?envelope?models.
	Such models are a special case of species distribution models in
	which the current geographical distribution of species is related
	to climatic variables so to enable projections of distributions under
	future climate change scenarios. This work reviews a number of critical
	methodological issues that may lead to uncertainty in predictions
	from bioclimatic modelling. Particular attention is paid to recent
	developments of bioclimatic modelling that address some of these
	issues as well as to the topics where more progress needs to be made.
	Developing and applying bioclimatic models in a informative way requires
	good understanding of a wide range of methodologies, including the
	choice of modelling technique, model validation, collinearity, autocorrelation,
	biased sampling of explanatory variables, scaling and impacts of
	non-climatic factors. A key challenge for future research is integrating
	factors such as land cover, direct CO2 effects, biotic interactions
	and dispersal mechanisms into species-climate models. We conclude
	that, although bioclimatic envelope models have a number of important
	advantages, they need to be applied only when users of models have
	a thorough understanding of their limitations and uncertainties.},

  year = {2011},

  pages = {1820-1832},

  abstract = {Tree height and crown allometries reflect adaptations for resource
	acquisition and structural stability, as well as plastic responses
	to a heterogeneous environment. While both light and soil resources
	limit growth and influence competitive responses in tropical forests,
	the effects of belowground resources on allometries are less understood,
	especially within the understory. To characterize outcomes of tree
	competition along an edaphic resource gradient, we quantified variation
	in height and crown allometries of six Bornean tree species from
	contrasting regeneration niches (light-demanding vs. shade-tolerant)
	on two soil habitats (clay-fine loam and sandy loam) within a 52-ha
	forest dynamics plot. Using empirically-fit allometric parameters
	and diameter growth rates from plot census data, we modeled tree
	height and crown area growth over the projected life span of each
	species. Based on resource competition theory, we hypothesized that
	tree species specializing on and populations of generalist species
	growing on the relatively moister, more fertile clay-fine loam soil
	habitat would have faster height and crown growth rates, compared
	to those on the sandy loam habitat, regardless of regeneration niche.
	Among soil specialists and within generalists of both genera, trees
	growing on clay-fine loam had taller stems and larger crowns at a
	given age and faster height and crown area growth rates at most sizes
	than trees on sandy loam. Differences in height and crown growth
	were driven by the faster diameter growth rates of trees on clay-fine
	loam, not by differences in height- and crown-diameter allometries,
	as trees on sandy loam were significantly taller at a given diameter,
	and differences in crown allometry were not consistent across soil
	habitats. Characterizing the height and crown growth responses of
	trees along resource gradients provides insight into the mechanisms
	that maintain diversity in tropical forests. Our results point to
	the importance of adaptive and plastic responses to both above and
	belowground resource availability in determining the allometric growth
	of trees and suggest that this diversity of responses may contribute
	tree species coexistence through competition-based trade-off mechanisms
	and variation in growth among individuals. Additionally, as the importance
	estimating natural carbon sequestration increases with the escalating
	effects of anthropogenic climate change, differences in tree growth
	and architecture across soil habitats also have implications for
	the approximation of forest carbon storage on heterogeneous tropical
	soils.},

  abstract = {Count data often show overdispersion compared to the Poisson distribution.
	Overdispersion is typically modeled by a random effect for the mean,
	based on the gamma distribution, leading to the negative binomial
	distribution for the count. This paper considers a larger family
	of mixture distributions, including the inverse Gaussian mixture
	distribution. It is demonstrated that it gives a significantly better
	fit for a data set on the frequency of epileptic seizures. The same
	approach can be used to generate counting processes from Poisson
	processes, where the rate or the time is random. A random rate corresponds
	to variation between patients, whereas a random time corresponds
	to variation within patients.},

  volume = {35},
  pages = {214-229},
  number = {2},
  abstract = {The hypothesis that seed or seedling predation by host-specific herbivores
	can explain the coexistence of the the large number of tree species
	in tropical forests, and produce a low density and uniform dispersion
	of adults of these tree species, is examined. On theoretical grounds,
	it is shown that spacing of conspecific adults can account for only
	a very small fraction of the observed tree species richness in tropical
	forests unless interadult distances are quite large. Moreover, in
	growing or declining populations, seed predation will not result
	in large-scale uniformity in adult dispersion patterns throughout
	the population. It results in uniformity in equilibrium populations
	only if the same spacing rule applies to all adult trees. However,
	adult trees differ enormously in seed production from year to year,
	and from young (small) to old (large) adults. High variance in seed
	production from tree to tree and year to year leads to heterogeneity
	in the intensity of seed predation and in the spacing distance between
	adults. This explains why the adults of most tropical tree species
	are clumped or randomly dispersed, and not uniformly spaced, in spite
	of heavy seed predation in many species. Because tree species are
	not everywhere as dense as would be predicted from observed nearest
	neighbor distances, it is concluded that other factors than seed
	predation limit the abundance of tropical tree species and prevent
	single-species dominance.}

  abstract = {Most industrial countries have implemented national forest inventories
	(NFIs) with systematic and permanent sample plots. These data are
	principally an excellent database for carbon accounting at tree-level.
	The purpose of this study was to establish tree-level functions for
	predicting aboveground biomass carbon of European beech. In a subsequent
	step these functions were applied to inventory data and the error
	of the predictions was assessed. The regression equations were based
	on a model data set of 116 trees of beech (Fagus sylvatica) sampled
	in four climatic regions of the western German state North Rhine-Westphalia
	(NRW). The tree parameters diameter at breast height (d), tree height
	(h) and as a proxy for climatic conditions the altitude (alt) were
	used as predictor variables. The estimated mean relative prediction
	error of the favoured d?h and d?h?alt models at tree-level was 16.7
	and 15.7%, respectively. The carbon content of wood ranged between
	48.9 and 50.7%. Beech forest in NRW stored on average 120 Mg C ha-1
	in the aboveground biomass (excluding understory and reserved beeches).
	The total prediction error was less than ?2%. Based on such a high
	precision and due to the fact that the identical inventory plots
	are remeasured, stock changes in the order of 1% can be detected.
	The main uncertainty arises from the sampling error of the inventory
	grid. Comparing the predicted increment and the potential harvest
	during the next decade suggests that the carbon stock stabilises
	within the range of uncertainty. Further, we predicted the biomass
	of the 116 sample trees with six published, mostly stand-specific
	functions. The relative mean prediction error of the calculated aboveground
	carbon content was about ?15?32% of the observed values at tree-level
	and ?10% over all sample trees. But most of the predictions were
	systematically biased. This illustrates the need to use regional
	functions based on a large model data set.},

  abstract = {The long-term effects of logging treatments on rainforest regeneration
	are difficult to quantify due to compounding interactions with natural
	dynamics, site characteristics and tree species. The aim of this
	study was to examine regeneration differences over a 36-year period
	in stands subjected to various levels of disturbance ranging from
	natural, through an increasing intensity of individual tree removal
	to intensive logging. Multivariate and univariate analyses of trees
	?10 cm diameter at 1.3 m above the ground (dbh) showed that regeneration
	responses were generally correlated with disturbance gradient. In
	the undisturbed controls there were gradual changes that had no significant
	effects on tree species richness and diversity, stem density, or
	diameter distribution. Gradual changes were also observed during
	the early stages of regeneration following logging. However, in logged
	sites changes in tree species richness and diversity, stem density
	and diameter distribution became more rapid with time, and significant
	changes were observed. Similar regeneration events across site and
	disturbance levels resulted in three identifiable stages. In the
	first stage, lasting about 10 years, stem density of abundant shade
	tolerant trees decreased with no discernable changes in tree species
	richness. In the second stage, also lasting about 10 years, tree
	species richness and diversity, as well as stem density decreased
	to minima due to localised species turnover and net mortality. In
	the third stage, recruitment surpassed mortality and reversed the
	net loss of both species and stems, as tree species assemblages began
	to return to pre-disturbance levels. Sites subjected to individual
	tree selective logging returned to their pre-logging states in all
	aspects within 35 years of logging, but diameter distribution of
	trees ?40 cm dbh showed low density compared to that observed in
	the controls. After 15?30 years, sites subjected to more intensive
	logging returned to their pre-logging levels of stem densities, species
	abundance and richness, but after 35?44 years of regeneration this
	sites had low species diversity and high densities of both the small
	sized stems and shade intolerant tree species. More intensively logged
	sites also had a low density of shade tolerant tree species compared
	to the controls. This suggests that the restoration of forest structure
	takes considerably longer than the restoration of tree species richness
	and abundance following logging in these forests. A high rate of
	stand basal area growth and a modest diameter distribution of lager
	trees ?40 cm dbh were observed in moderate tree selection logging.
	This indicates high timber production potential at moderate tree
	selection rate in this type of forest. However, if the stem size
	distribution of larger trees is to be maintained, a logging cycle
	longer than 50 years is necessary.},

  abstract = {A geographically extended model of the dynamics of tree size structure
	of forests is proposed to simulate the change of forest zonation
	along latitude in response to global environmental change. To predict
	the response of forests to global change, it is necessary to construct
	functional models of forest tree populations. The size-structure-based
	model requires far less memory and steps of calculation compared
	with individual-based models, and it is easy to incorporate the dimension
	of geographic locations into the model to describe large-scale dynamics
	of forest-type distributions. The effect of increasing size growth
	rate, expected from increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide, was diminished
	at the stand-level basal area density, because of regulation by one-sided
	competition. Model simulations of a century-long global warming at
	around 3C predicted that (1) biomass changed in resident forests
	rather simultaneously in response to warming, and that (2) there
	was a considerable time lag in movement at the boundaries of different
	forest types, particularly under the existence of resident forest
	types that would be finally replaced. It required several thousand
	years after a century-long warming spell for forest types to attain
	new steady-state distributions after shifting. As a consequence,
	global warming created a zigzag pattern of biomass distribution along
	a latitudinal gradient, i.e., an increase in the cooler-side boundary
	of forest types and a decrease in the warmer-side boundary.},

  abstract = {Selecting a suitable level of accuracy in stand growth estimations
	is a question of practical importance. A detailed model is more complicated
	and demands more initial information from the user to produce reliable
	results. Despite being correct and more precise, it may well be that
	the more detailed results give no practical bonus value. The essential
	part of the estimations could also have been received with coarser
	means. We have used three levels of stand description accuracy. The
	first is a mean tree model (MTM), where all trees are assumed identical.
	The second is a distribution-based model (DBM), where size differences
	are allowed. Both versions are distance-independent and the spatial
	configuration of the stand is considered random. The third is a spatially
	explicit model (SEM), where all trees are described individually
	and their spatial locations are taken into account. The core dynamics
	in all models are kept the same, so a previous model is a straightforward
	aggregation of the latter one. The possibility of a perfect aggregation
	was examined both theoretically and by practical simulations. A process-based
	stand growth model ACROBAS was used to simulate the different levels
	of aggregation. The results demonstrate that under the Poisson assumption
	of stand spatial configuration there are hardly any differences among
	model aggregations. As mortality is not totally random in the SEM,
	the Poisson assumption does not hold through the whole simulation
	period. As the spatial configuration eventually tends toward regularity,
	the total growth in the stand is somewhat increased, which is evident
	in variables such as total stem volume and foliage mass. However,
	mean height and stocking density developments are almost identical
	in all models. This suggests that the mean height is ?an almost perfect?
	aggregation variable.},

	examined relationships between population size, individual growth,
	survival and reproduction, and population growth rate in the perennial
	plant Phyteuma spicatum. Population size positively affected the
	growth of seedlings, the survival of juveniles, the proportion of
	adults flowering, and potential seed production. Analyses with integral
	projection models, however, showed no relationship between population
	size and population growth rate. This was due to the fact that herbivores
	and pathogens eliminated the relationship between population size
	and seed production, and that population growth rate was not sensitive
	to changes in the vital rates that varied with population size. We
	conclude that effects of population size on vital rates must not
	translate into effects on population growth rate, and that populations
	of long-lived organisms may partly be able to buffer negative effects
	of small population size on vital rates that have a relatively small
	influence on population growth rate. Our study illustrates that we

  abstract = {In tropical rainforests, the increased light associated with the formation
	of treefall gaps can have a critical impact on the growth and survivorship
	of understory plants. Here we examine both leaf-level and whole-plant
	responses to simulated light gap formation by two common shade-tolerant
	shrubs, Hybanthus prunifolius and Ouratea lucens. The species were
	chosen because they differed in leaf lifespans, a trait that has
	been correlated with a number of leaf- and plant-level processes.
	Ouratea leaves typically live about 5 years, while Hybanthus leaves
	live less than 1 year. Potted plants were placed in the understory
	shade for 2 years before transfer to a light gap. After 2 days in
	high light, leaves of both species showed substantial photoinhibition,
	including reduced CO2 fixation, Fv/Fm and light use efficiency, although
	photoinhibition was most severe in Hybanthus. After 17 days in high
	light, leaves of both species were no longer photoinhibited. In response
	to increased light, Ouratea made very few new leaves, but retained
	most of its old leaves which increased photosynthetic capacity by
	50%. Within a few weeks of transfer to high light, Hybanthus had
	dropped nearly all of its shade leaves and made new leaves that had
	a 2.5-fold greater light-saturated photosynthetic rate. At 80 days
	after transfer, the number of new leaves was 4.9-fold the initial
	leaf number. After 80 days in high light, Hybanthus had approximately
	tenfold greater productivity than Ouratea when leaf area, photosynthetic
	capacity, and leaf dark respiration rate were all taken into account.
	Although both species are considered shade tolerant, we found that
	their growth responses were quite different following transfer from
	low to high light. The short-lived Hybanthus leaves were quickly
	dropped, and a new canopy of sun leaves was produced. In contrast,
	Ouratea showed little growth response at the whole-plant level, but
	a greater ability to tolerate light stress and acclimate at the leaf
	level. These differences are consistent with predictions based on
	leaf lifespan and are discussed within the context of other traits
	associated with shade-tolerant syndromes.},

	extension to the Leslie matrix. The model allows a projection of
	the transient dynamics of a population from an arbitrary set of starting
	numbers. It also allows some asymptotic properties of the population
	to be determined, namely, the finite rate of increase, the stable
	age/size distribution, and the reproductive values. In the special
	case of reproduction and survival being independent of size, the
	model reduces to a Leslie matrix. In the special case of reproduction
	and mortality being independent of age, it yields results which approximate
	to a form of the stage projection matrix (Lefkovitch matrix). The

	Consequently, predicting occurrence, frequency, and composition of
	ingrowth is a challenging task but of great importance in long-term
	forest growth and yield model projections. However, ingrowth data
	often require different statistical techniques other than traditional
	Gaussian regression, because these data are often bounded, skewed,
	and non-normal and commonly contain a large fraction of zeros. This
	study presents a set of regression models based on discrete Poisson
	and negative binomial probability distributions for ingrowth data
	collected from permanent sample plots in the Acadian Forest Region
	of North America. Models considered here include regular Poisson,
	zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP), zero-altered Poisson (ZAP; hurdle Poisson),
	regular negative binomial (NB), zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB),
	and zero-altered negative binomial (ZANB; hurdle NB). Plot-level
	random effects were incorporated into each of these models. The ZINB
	model with random effects was found to provide the best fit statistics
	for modeling annualized occurrence and frequency of ingrowth. The
	key explanatory variables were stand basal area per hectare, percentage
	of hardwood basal area, number of trees per hectare, a measure of
	site quality, and the minimum measured diameter at breast height
	of each plot. A similar model was developed to predict species composition.
	All models showed logical behavior despite the high variability observed
	in the original data.},

	practical question in ecology. Species richness and biomass accumulation
	are familiar figures of merit, but they cannot be instant watched.
	Self-organization is a tacit character. However, methods to measure
	the degree of self-organization of ecosystem are problematic. To
	this end Lin et al. (2009) have devised indicators of energy capture
	and dissipation so that self-organization defined via maximum energy
	dissipation can be quantified easily. Here the method is used to
	analyze long-term data (2004?2006) of a tropical seasonal rain forest
	included in the ChinaFLUX program. Three years of average self-organization
	values were clearly separated by seasonal variation. Reflection and
	long wave radiation are the main two pathways of energy loss. For
	tropical seasonal rain forest studied, long wave radiation contributed
	most to energy loss, and was negatively correlated with energy capture
	ability (Rn/DR). The nocturnal difference between canopy and air
	temperatures had a strong negative correlation with the long wave
	radiation loss ratio. However, the long wave radiation loss ratio
	was slightly lower than the reflection loss ratio in rainy season,
	when values were very low. Precipitation and wind had significant
	impact on energy dissipation ability in the hot dry season, but the
	correlation coefficients between precipitation and wind with thermal
	response numbers (TRNs) were very low. The results indicated that
	the self-organization estimation system based on ?maximum energy
	dissipation theory? is applicable for tropical forest.},

	simple and detailed approaches could help to obtain mathematically
	tractable models which are based on physiological and ecological
	processes. This can be achieved either by extending simpler models
	with components of complex ones, or by a controlled simplification
	of complex models. Forest models ranging from models describing processes
	in organs of individual tress in three-dimensional space to models
	averaging over all trees of an entire region, are reviewed, categorized
	by hierarchical level and represented in a general mathematical formulation.
	Possibilities and approaches of transitions between the approaches,

  journal = oikos,
  year = {2000},
  volume = {91},
  pages = {3-17},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has
	emerged as a major scientific issue today. As experiments progress,
	there is a growing need for adequate theories and models to provide
	robust interpretations and generalisations of experimental results,
	and to formulate new hypotheses. This paper provides an overview
	of recent theoretical advances that have been made on the two major
	questions in this area: (1) How does biodiversity affect the magnitude
	of ecosystem processes (short-term effects of biodiversity)? (2)
	How does biodiversity contribute to the stability and maintenance
	of ecosystem processes in the face of perturbations (long-term effects
	of biodiversity)? Positive short-term effects of species diversity
	on ecosystem processes, such as primary productivity and nutrient
	retention, have been explained by two major types of mechanisms:
	(1) functional niche complementarity (the complementarity effect),
	and (2) selection of extreme trait values (the selection effect).
	In both cases, biodiversity provides a range of phenotypic trait
	variation. In the complementarity effect, trait variation then forms
	the basis for a permanent differentiation of function between species
	that enhances collective performance. In the selection effect, trait
	variation comes into play only as an initial condition, and a selective
	process then promotes dominance by species with extreme trait values.
	Major differences between within-site effects of biodiversity and
	across-site productivity?diversity patterns have also been clarified.
	The local effect of diversity on ecosystem processes are expected
	to be masked by the effects of varying environmental parameters in
	across-site comparisons. A major reappraisal of the paradigm that
	has dominated during the last decades seems necessary if we are to
	account for long-term effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning.
	The classical deterministic, equilibrium approaches to stability
	do not explain the reduced temporal variability of aggregate ecosystem
	properties that has been observed in more diverse systems. On the
	other hand, stochastic, nonequilibrium approaches do show two types
	of biodiversity effects on ecosystem productivity in a fluctuating
	environment: (1) a buffering effect, i.e., a reduction in the temporal
	variance; and (2) a performance-enhancing effect, i.e., an increase
	in the temporal mean. The basic mechanisms involved in these long-term
	insurance effects are very similar to those that operate in short-term
	biodiversity effects: temporal niche complementarity, and selection
	of extreme trait values. The ability of species diversity to provide
	an insurance against environmental fluctuations and a reservoir of
	variation allowing adaptation to changing conditions may be critical
	in a long-term perspective. These recent theoretical developments
	in the area of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning suggest that
	linking community and ecosystem ecology is a fruitful avenue, which
	paves the way for a new ecological synthesis.},

	decreases continuously as the nutrient transport rate increases in
	food chains with donor-controlled or no herbivory, while it increases
	continuously or is greatest at an intermediate value of the nutrient
	transport rate in herbivore-controlled food chains. On the other

  abstract = {Savanna trees can either increase or decrease the productivity of
	understorey grasses. Trees reduce grass growth through competition
	for nutrients, water and light and can facilitate grass production
	through increased soil nutrient availability, shade and hydraulic
	lift. In an East African savanna in Tarangire, I studied what determines
	whether Acacia tortilis trees interfere or facilitate understorey
	grass growth and especially whether trees stimulate grass growth
	through hydraulic lift. The availability and concentration of all
	major nutrients is much higher under trees compared to open grassland.
	This increased nutrient availability under trees changes the nutrient
	limitation of the herbaceous layer from nitrogen limited in open
	grassland to phosphorus limitation under the tree canopy. The water
	availability however was lower under compared to outside tree canopies
	although we found clear evidence of hydraulic lift. However, exuding
	large amounts of water into the topsoil (up to 235 l. per night per
	tree) by large trees through hydraulic lift, could not compensate
	for water competition between trees and grasses. However grasses
	probably have access to hydraulically lifted water which indicates
	that hydraulic lift reduces the severity of water competition between
	trees and grasses. So the main processes regulating tree-grass interactions
	in this East-African savanna are water competition and increased
	soil nutrient availability. This balance between positive and negative
	effects of trees on grass growth resulted in equal grass productivity
	under and outside tree canopies. Although Acacia tortilis trees did
	not increase grass productivity, they did have a positive effect
	on the grass quality for herbivores. Grasses growing under trees
	have higher nutrient and protein concentrations. Grasses from open
	grassland, however, have such a low quality that wildebeest cannot
	maintain a stable body weight by only selecting food from open grassland
	but need forage from under trees. Large trees are thus essential
	for the survival of wildebeest in Tarangire National Park.},

	(ERM). There may also be a gain of phenomena not represented at the
	small scale, which can be dealt with by what is called phenomena-added
	modelling (PAM). As an example of ERM, a Monte Carlo procedure, called
	Latin hypercube sampling, is used to estimate annual photosynthate
	production of an oak/hickory [Quercus sp./Carya sp.] forest in Tennessee
	under three atmospheric CO2 concentrations. PAM is illustrated by
	scaling up spatially from a vegetated plot to a watershed, and scaling
	up temporally from a physiological model with hourly time steps to
	a forest-succession model operating on annual time steps. Where large-scale
	processes take place on a time scale similar to, or faster than,
	that of small-scale processes (plot/watershed case), less computation
	is required if the small-scale processes are built into the large-scale
	model and ERM is conducted with the expanded model. PAM may be conducted
	by information transfer from a small-scale simulator to a large-scale
	simulator. This is also possible with Latin hypercube sampling by
	using the output frequency distributions from the small-scale model
	as input distributions for the large-scale model. The final outputs
	at the large scale are also frequency distributions, and these can
	be used to determine confidence intervals for statistical comparisons
	among modelling scenarios. The ERM and PAM methods are data and computer
	intensive; nevertheless, they can fill an important need for addressing

  abstract = {From 1987 to 1996 we used capture and telemetry methods to study the
	demography, movements, and population trend of grizzly bears (Ursus
	arctos horribilis) in wilderness and nonwilderness portions of the
	Swan Mountains of Montana. Most data were collected in the nonwilderness
	portion, which included public multiple-use lands and rural areas
	on and near private lands. Population density in nonwilderness averaged
	1.6 bears/100 $km^2$. The annual total mortality rate (13.4%) was
	higher than that found in expanding brown bear (Ursus arctos) populations.
	A tenuous finite rate of increase $(\lambda)$ of 0.977 (95% CI =
	0.875-1.046) was related to high female mortality. Annual mortality
	rates for bears utilizing the rural and wilderness zones was 21 and
	15 times higher, respectively, than for bears using only multiple-use
	lands. Our mortality, movement, and occupancy data suggest that the
	multiple-use zone is a population source area, and that wilderness
	and rural zones are sink areas. Mortalities in the wilderness zone
	were from mistaken identification during the black bear (Ursus americanus)
	hunting season and human defense of life. In the rural zone, mortalities
	were from malicious killing and the management removal of habituated
	or food-conditioned bears. We recommend that wildlife managers develop
	a conservation strategy to promote bear population stability or growth
	by improving female survival while minimizing bear conflicts on private
	lands. This would be accomplished by protecting core areas on public
	lands of superior habitat through access management, conducting a
	mandatory bear identification course for black bear hunters, and
	reducing anthropogenic foods on private lands. We also recommend
	a continuing population and habitat monitoring program.},

	avifaunas of landscapes of central Victoria, Australia, where relative-abundance
	patterns in more affected landscapes bear little resemblance to reference

	distributions: (1) analyses that do not depend on the identity of
	individual species and (2) abundance spectra, which use ordered lists
	of species ranked by species? commonness in reference systems. While
	abundance spectra change dramatically in smaller remnants, relative-abundance
	distributions change little, suggesting that the ?reorganization?
	of abundances occurs over ecological time frames. The dispersal-limited
	multinomial is a flexible distribution that may fit many data sets
	yet be unrelated to assumptions (species neutrality) and processes
	(fixed total numbers of individuals) of the unified neutral theory.
	A more complete understanding of human impacts at landscape scales

	by change, as well as those that will be disadvantaged.},

	(HEC). It consists of two layers. The first employs a number of principal
	component analysis subnetworks to estimate the hyperellipsoidal shapes
	of currently formed clusters. The second performs competitive learning
	using the cluster shape information from the first. The network performs
	partitional clustering using the proposed regularized Mahalanobis
	distance, which was designed to deal with the problems in estimating
	the Mahalanobis distance when the number of patterns in a cluster
	is less than or not considerably larger than the dimensionality of
	the feature space during clustering. This distance also achieves
	a tradeoff between hyperspherical and hyperellipsoidal cluster shapes
	so as to prevent the HEC network from producing unusually large or
	small clusters. The significance level of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
	test on the distribution of the Mahalanobis distances of patterns
	in a cluster to the cluster center under the Gaussian cluster assumption
	is used as a compactness measure. The HEC network has been tested
	on a number of artificial data sets and real data sets, We also apply
	the HEC network to texture segmentation problems. Experiments show
	that the HEC network leads to a significant improvement in the clustering
	results over the K-means algorithm with Euclidean distance. Our results
	on real data sets also indicate that hyperellipsoidal shaped clusters
	are often encountered in practice.},

	data to analyze. Although the main tools in astronomy for comparing
	theoretical results with observation are statistical, in recent years,
	cosmologists have not been generally aware of the developments in
	statistics and vice versa. Statistics of the Galaxy Distribution
	describes both the available observational data on the distribution
	of galaxies and the applications of spatial statistics in cosmology.
	It gives a detailed derivation of the statistical methods used to
	study the galaxy distribution and the cosmological physics needed
	to formulate the statistical models. Because the prevalent approach
	in cosmological statistics has been frequentist, the authors focus
	on the most widely used of these methods, but they also explore Bayesian
	techniques that have become popular in large-scale structure studies.
	Cosmology's well-defined and growing data sets represent an important
	challenge for the statistical analysis, and therefore for the statistics
	community. Statistics of the Galaxy Distribution presents a unique
	opportunity for researchers in both fields to strengthen the connection
	between them and, using a common language, explore the statistical
	description of the universe.}

  abstract = {Aim This paper presents the Joint Research Centre's TREES Project
	satellite derived Vegetation Map of Central Africa, at 1:5,000,000
	scale, with a detailed description of the vegetation classes and
	their distribution. The information content of the map is compared
	with other conventional and satellite derived maps of the region
	for validation and evaluation purposes. Location The map focuses
	on the Guineo-Congolian ecological domain and covers the following
	countries: Cameroon, Central African Republic, Republic of Congo,
	Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Methods
	Using coarse resolution satellite imagery a map of vegetation cover
	has been produced based upon the spectral response of the vegetation
	cover. Digital image processing and geographical information systems
	techniques were employed, together with local knowledge, high resolution
	imagery and expert consultation, to compile a cartographic map product.
	Results The TREES Vegetation Map of Central Africa has been shown
	to be strongly correlated with the FAO Forest Resources Assessment
	for 1990. Comparison with other map sources indicates that the map
	contains greater spatial detail and is more consistent than conventionally
	compiled maps. The conventional maps however, contain more thematic
	information content relating to vegetation type. Main conclusions
	The map improves our state of knowledge of the vegetation cover of
	Central Africa and presents the most consistent and spatially detailed
	view yet published at this scale. Thematic information content on
	forest type is limited but should be improved in the near future
	with the inclusion of data from new satellite sensors. This first
	version of the map and future planned updates should provide an important
	input for regional stratification and planning purposes for forest
	resources, biodiversity and climate studies.},

  abstract = {Validation is a necessary step for model acceptance. No single combination
	of validation tests will be applicable across the diverse range of
	models and their uses. Choice of technique is important, as some
	contain problems and inconsistencies. Subjective assessment can be
	useful as a guide. Within visual techniques, observed vs. predicted
	plots are shown to have superior diagnostic capabilities compared
	to the more widely-used time-series plots. Mean absolute error is
	demonstrated as a more robust deviance measure than mean absolute
	percent error, and within the statistical tests a nominated sub-set
	of some simpler statistics should reveal most of the required information.
	The modelling efficiency is proposed as the best overall measure
	of agreement between observed and simulated values.}

  abstract = {1 Tree-falls and branch-falls of all trees with a diameter at breast
	height (d.b.h.) of over 10 cm were studied in 12 ha of primary rain
	forest at Nouragues, French Guiana. Consequences in terms of the
	number of damaged trees and number and sizes of resulting canopy
	gaps were investigated. Spatial distribution of tree-falls and spatial
	relation with pre-existing canopy gaps were analysed. Forest turnover
	rates were calculated on different bases. 2 Of the 6314 trees initially
	present in the plot 1.5% had fallen and 1.3% lost at least one major
	branch after one year. In total, 4.9% of the standing basal area
	had been felled or damaged. 3 The major cause of tree-fall and tree
	damage is falling trees and limbs: 75% of the fallen and 83% of the
	damaged trees were felled or damaged by others (`domino-wise' felled
	or damaged trees). Of the remaining (`initiating') fallen trees,
	38% were uprooted and 62% were snapped-off above the ground. Similar
	percentages were observed for domino-wise felled trees. 4 The spatial
	distribution of the 38 trees which initiated events was random. Pre-existing
	canopy gaps did not increase the chances of surrounding trees to
	initiate a tree- or branch-fall. However, initiating tree- and branch-falls
	were found clustered at around 50 m from large gaps, while few gaps
	occurred at around 25 m from old gaps. 5 Some 35% of the fallen trees
	did not create canopy gaps, and 42% of the damaged trees were not
	involved in the creation of a canopy gap. Initiating tree-fall that
	resulted in a canopy gap had no larger d.b.h. than initiating tree-fall
	not resulting in a canopy gap. In contrast, gap-creating branch-fall
	trees had a larger d.b.h. than those that did not create gaps. 6
	Gap size increased with the number and basal area of the trees involved.
	Gap size measured following the Brokaw (1982a) definition was not
	very relevant in quantifying the direct consequences of gap creation,
	and a modified gap definition is proposed. 7 Both the forest turnover
	rate based on the number of fallen trees and the turnover rate based
	on the area of canopy gaps underestimate the actual disturbance regime
	of the forest. To quantify the disturbance regime of a forest, the
	basal area of the annually fallen and damaged trees deserves more
	attention.}

	must, therefore, rely upon a set of instructions or documentation

	the various existing interpretations of the mean-field concept can
	imply different meanings. Then we classify and compare various methods
	of reducing spatially explicit models to mean-field models: spatial

	of IBMs. We emphasize the importance of spatial scales in the reduction
	of spatially explicit models and briefly consider the inverse problem
	of scaling up local ecological interactions from microscales to macroscales.
	Then we discuss the current challenges and limitations for construction
	of mean-field population models. We emphasize the need for developing
	mixed methods based on a combination of various reduction techniques
	to cope with the spatio-temporal complexity of real ecosystems including
	processes taking place on multiple time and space scales. Finally,
	we argue that the construction of analytically tractable mean-field
	models is becoming a key issue to provide an insight into the major
	mechanisms of ecosystem functioning. We complete this review by introducing
	the contributions to the current special issue of Ecological Complexity.},

	can be set equal to the model predicted proportion of empty patches.
	The parameter k of the negative binomial will, for a given mean density
	mu, be a root in this equation. (3) The model is fitted to the data
	of the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) and its phytoseiid
	predator Phytoseiulus persimilis, and the density behaviour of 1/k
	is predicted. The agreement between observed and expected values

	values of 1/k obtained by the method of maximum likelihood. A test

  abstract = {The concept of species redundancy in ecosystem processes is troublesome
	because it appears to contradict the traditional emphasis in ecology
	on species singularity. When species richness is high, however, ecosystem
	processes seem clearly insensitive to considerable variation in biodiversity.
	Some elementary principles from reliability engineering, where engineered
	redundancy is a valued part of systems design, suggest that we should
	rethink our stance on species redundancy. For example, a central
	tenet of reliability engineering is that reliability always increases
	as redundant components are added to a system, a principle that directly
	supports redundant species as guarantors of reliable ecosystem functioning.
	I argue that we should embrace species redundancy and perceive redundancy
	as a critical feature of ecosystems which must be preserved if ecosystems
	are to function reliably and provide us with goods and services.
	My argument is derived from basic principles of reliability engineering
	which demonstrate that the probability of reliable system performance
	is closely tied to the level of engineered redundancy in its design.
	Empirical demonstrations of the value of species redundancy in ecosystem
	reliability would provide new insights into the ecology of communities

	forest in Japan was simulated by a size-structure dynamics model
	incorporating the asymmetrical (one-sided) effect of shading between
	these two life-form guilds. The model assumes that the crowding effect
	due to one-sided competition for light on a tree of a given size
	regulates the rate of size growth and recruitment. The cumulative
	basal area of trees larger than a given tree in the forest is employed
	to express the intensity of one-sided competition on that tree. Cumulative
	basal areas of both guilds negatively affected the growth rate of
	any tree. The shading effect by conifers on the growth rate of either
	guild was stronger than that by broad-leaved species. Two types of
	model were tested for recruitment; an additive and a reciprocal model.
	A reciprocal model, where basal area density of conifers and broad-leaved
	species has a negative effect on the recruitment of its own guild
	but has a positive effect on that of the other guild, fit the observed
	data better than an additive model where total basal area of the
	two guilds suppresses recruitment rates. Simulations using these
	models showed that, within a particular range of the set of recruitment
	rates, the two guilds could coexist. The tendency for reciprocal
	replacement, incorporated in the reciprocal model, substantially

	Amazon. Radar data quality has improved: A novel digital model of
	vegetation height from X- and P-band interferometry is available
	along with the usual P-band backscatter information. The digital
	vegetation height model is derived from the interferometric surface
	models of the ground (from P-band) and the forest canopy (from X-band).
	The difference between the surface models is called ?interferometric
	height,? and is used as a measure of vegetation height. Interferometric
	height is shown to relate to a subset of the forest trees that changes
	according to the forest successional stages. The suitability of radar
	backscatter and interferometric height as a means for forest and
	biomass monitoring was explored by relating forest parameters as
	measured in the field to remote sensing data. Basal area and biomass
	were related to radar backscatter with limited precision of r2 =
	0.19 and r2 = 0.34, respectively. Mean forest height is shown to
	relate to interferometric height with good precision (r2 = 0.83,
	RMSE = 4.1 m). A statistical model for forest biomass as a function
	of both P-band backscatter and interferometric height information
	not only arrives at high values of precision (with r2 = 0.89 and
	a RMSE from cross-validation of only 46.1 t/ha), but also overcomes
	the well-known issue of backscatter saturation. This research shows
	that tropical forest biomass can be quantified and mapped over large
	areas for a range of forest structures with reasonably tight and
	similar errors.},

	was measured in terms of similarity and heterogeneity and explored
	at beta and gamma levels. Over 315 species were encountered during
	the study. In terms of species richness, there are 80, 226, 163,
	137 and 159 species in Gambari, Oban, Omo, Owan and Sapoba, respectively.
	The occurrence of the species showed that, while 26 species are common
	to all the sites, 62, 17, 15, 8 and 6 species are restricted to Oban,
	Omo, Sapoba, Gambari and Owan, respectively. Ordination by detrended
	correspondence analysis indicated gradients along the first two axes.
	The first axis reflecting rainfall gradient which decreases from
	Oban through to Sapoba, Owan and Gambari. The second axis showed
	a separation of Omo, and Owan and Sapoba. This suggests a gradient
	of soil parent materials, the former site is on the basement complex
	while the latter is on the cretaceous rock. It is suggested that
	each forest should be managed based on its particular characteristics,
	such as species composition and abundance. Thus, forests with high
	species diversity but fewer numbers of individuals, such as in Oban,
	should be earmarked for conservation while species-rich forests with
	relatively more economic species, as in Sapoba and Omo, should be
	managed for sustained timber production. Floristically poor forest,
	such as those in Gambari and Owan, should be converted to plantations
	of fast growing species but with care taken to avoid exposing such
	sites to soil erosion.},

  abstract = {A review of previous evaluations of long-term changes in treated Nigerian
	rain forest is presented, to show that these studies have concentrated
	on economic species with little consideration of other species, or
	of forest biomass and structure. We examine regeneration and successional
	patterns in Omo Forest Reserve by comparing enumeration data taken
	before (1952) and after (1981) treatment of the forest by selective
	canopy opening and climber-cutting (Plot A), or clear-felling and
	burning (Walsh system) (Plot C). Before treatment, about 50 species
	in 25 families were found of stems ?10 cm dbh, in 4.05 ha of the
	forest, the Euphorbiaceae contributing the greatest number of species
	while the medium-sized trees Diospyros alboflavescens (Ebenaceae)
	and Strombosia pustulata (Olacaceae) contributed more than 40% of
	the stems. Twenty-eight years after treatment (1981) the number of
	species and families remained similar to those in 1952, although
	smaller areas (0.75 ha) were enumerated; the treated plots were,
	however, dominated by early succession species such as Macaranga
	barteri, Musanga cecropioides, Cleistopholis patens, Funtumia elastica
	and Fagara macrophylla, and lacked an abundance of the ?economic?
	species that treatment had been expected to induce; the medium-sized
	trees that were dominant in 1952 were still abundant in Plot A but
	not in Plot C. For stems ? 30 cm dbh tree diversity (reciprocal of
	Simpson's index) was highest (15.7) in a 1952 plot and least (4.8)
	in the clear-felled plot enumerated in 1981; diversity of the 1952
	plots, however, fell markedly to values lower than those for the
	1981 plots when computation was based on all stems ?10 cm dbh, presumably
	because of increase in abundance of small-stemmed species like Diospyros
	spp., Strombosia sp. and Rinorea sp., each represented by a large
	number of stems. Basal area was greatest (29.6 m2 ha-1) in the 1952
	plots and least (12.7 m2 ha-1) in the clear-felled plots enumerated
	in 1981, but the relative distribution of basal area and number of
	stems in size-classes was similar in all the plots. Mean annual increment,
	computed by dividing the mean diameter (7.50 cm) of the stems in
	the clear-felled plots by the number of years (28) over which they
	had grown, was 0.27 cm. Nauclea diderrichii dominated the seedling
	regeneration from the first year after clear-felling and burning
	(1954) till the sixth year (1960), when seedlings of the Meliaceae
	entered the regeneration list and overall seedling density was 395
	per hectare. Among the plots assessed in 1981, the standing crop
	was greatest in an untreated Control plot (229.6 t ha-1) followed
	by Plot A (159.7 t ha-1) and Plot C (91.1 t ha7-1), but the relative
	allocation of biomass to stem, branch, leaf, root and fruit fractions
	was comparable for all plots. The data are discussed in relation
	to other Nigerian forest studies and it is suggested that the main
	qualitative features of structural organization and the species composition
	of the top canopy synusia of mature secondary rain forest may be
	determined quite early in the development of the stand.},

	the total basal area increased indicating movement of trees into
	larger-diameter classes. There was a complete absence of first-generation
	succession species and a decrease in the total number of species
	as the stand aged. The forest structure progressed towards climax
	vegetation, while the relative positions of the species and families

	that the whole forest was in a state of decline because the dominant
	eigenvalue of the matrix was 0.97, that is the intrinsic rate of
	natural increase was less than zero. The result of a sensitivity
	analysis showed that a high recruitment rate would not necessarily
	favour changes in the dynamic status of the tree population. On the

	would sustain and stabilize the forest.},

	of the log truck scheduling problem where each column represents
	a feasible route. We generate a large pool of columns based on solving
	a transportation problem. Then we apply a composite pricing algorithm,
	which mainly consists of pricing the pool of columns and maintain
	an active set of these, for solving the LP relaxed model. A branch
	and price approach is used to obtain integer solutions in which we
	apply composite pricing to generate new columns. Numerical results
	from case studies at Swedish forestry companies are presented.},

	Ceptometer, CI-100 Plant Canopy Analyzer, image processing with the

	of a logarithmic regression equation. The image processing method

	real or merely a function of the limited sample size.},

  abstract = {The controlled extraction of timber from the Budongo Forest Reserve
	began in the 1930s. From the start of the operations it was intended
	that the timber should be harvested on a sustainable yield basis
	and the first of several 10-year working plans for the forest was
	drawn up in 1933. This paper documents the volume of timber removed,
	the date of logging, date of arboricide treatment and volume of arboricide
	applied in most compartments in the forest. Four species of mahogany
	formed about 65% of the timber extracted and this remained almost
	constant over the years despite attempts to encourage the use of
	other species by the Uganda Forest Department. Forest type maps made
	from sets of aerial photographs taken in 1951 and 1990 showed an
	increase in ?mixed forest? at the expense of ?Cynometrforest?; one
	of the major aims of the arboricide treatment. Ordination of the
	basal areas of the common tree species showed that the geographical
	position of a compartment explained more of the variation in species
	distribution than the variation between adjacent logged and unlogged
	compartments. A more detailed inventory of all species of tree in
	eight compartments across the forest showed greater species richness
	in the west of the forest and greater species richness in logged
	compartments. Measures of forest structure showed that more than
	50 years is required for the forest to recover to pre-logging levels.},

	adult stature of tree species within a community, independently of
	each other, determine species' architectural traits was tested by
	comparing 53 Liberian rain forest tree species. We evaluated whether
	species differed in their tree height, crown depth, and crown diameter,
	when compared at a standardized size of 15-cm diameter at breast
	height, and how their architecture changed early during ontogeny.
	Tree height was positively correlated with adult stature and light
	demand. By producing a relatively slender stem, large-stature species
	are able to rapidly reach their reproductive size, at a low cost
	for construction and support. Light-demanding species need a slender
	stem to be able to attain or maintain a position in the canopy. Both
	crown depth and crown diameter were negatively correlated with adult
	stature, but not with light demand. This is in contrast with the
	hypothesis that shade-tolerant species should have a shallow crown
	to reduce self-shading in a light-limited environment. Investing
	energy in height growth rather than lateral crown growth allows a
	rapid vertical stem extension, but crown diameter has to be sufficiently
	small to reduce the risk of mechanical failure. All architectural
	patterns were maintained during ontogeny. The key factors driving
	interspecific differences in tree architecture are the costs of height
	extension and mechanical stability. In general, light demand and
	adult stature represent independent axes of architectural differentiation,
	affecting tree architecture in different ways.},

	are subjected to spatial, environmental constraints. At the same
	time, planning and the cost of road access over the medium-term planning
	horizon must be considered. This article presents a model and heuristic
	solution methodology to address stand level harvest scheduling and
	the associated road construction scheduling problem. The model is
	formulated to determine minimal cost schedules, for stand harvests
	and road construction, that achieve recommended timber harvest volume
	targets and that comply with environmental regulations. The harvest
	decisions are made at the stand level of resolution. Graph structures
	are used to formulate the spatial restrictions on clearcut opening
	size and location. Road construction projects are scheduled to create
	a feasible road network at minimum net present capital cost. The
	optimization problem is solved using a Tabu search heuristic, which
	includes special constructs to cope with the complexity of this problem.
	An efficient frontier of solutions is produced, which may be utilized
	to analyse trade-offs between lost forest productivity, due to harvest
	timing, and the capital cost of road construction.},

	Buttresses tend to grow on the side of the tree that faces the prevailing
	winds, thereby functioning as tension members that help prevent the
	tree from being blown over. The buttresses become proportionately
	larger as the tree grows, providing the tree with greater support
	as its crown becomes exposed to the stronger winds of the upper forest
	canopy. In particular, buttress height increases much faster than
	tree height. This disproportionate increase reduces by $\approx15\%$
	the potential vulnerability of the trunk to snapping or twisting
	under stress due to winds. On the other hand, no specific relationship
	independent of tree size can be demonstrated between the length of
	a buttress and the radius of the crown above or opposite that buttress.
	There is thus no evidence that buttresses counteract stresses due
	to crown asymmetries of a particular trees.},

	a 40-year period (1940?1980) in an even-aged mixed Pinusresinosa
	Ait. ? Pinusstrobus L. stand represent a stationary Markov process.
	Transition probabilities were constructed from growth data on 202
	trees = 5.1 cm DBH in a 0.4-ha permanent plot. For each species,
	a diameter distribution in 1980 was predicted with the stationary
	Markov model using the 1940?1950 transition probability matrix. The
	predicted and observed 1980 distributions were significantly different
	for P. resinosa (?2 = 31.67, p < 0.01), but not P. strobus (?2 =
	7.86, not significant). In P. resinosa, growth rates of trees in
	the same diameter class at different points in time declined with
	increasing stand age. This violates the assumption of stationarity.
	Growth did not decline in most diameter classes in P. strobus. The
	model also assumes that differences in the competitive histories
	of trees of the same size do not affect transition probabilities.
	The average growth rates of trees in different crown classes within
	two diameter classes were significantly different for P. resinosa,
	but not for P. strobus. Both assumptions of the model were violated
	in the case of P. resinosa. The.model was not rejected for P. strobus
	because it is a midtolerant species capable of relatively constant

	were: (1) to determine if damage incidence to future crop trees (FCTs;
	?20 cm diameter at breast height (dbh)) differs between (a) forest
	with and without bamboo (Guadua spp.), and (b) trees with and without
	lianas; (2) to what extent harvesting can be conducted more intensely
	(m3ha-1), without incurring greater FCT damage; and (3) to what extent
	marking diminishes FCT damage. Full inventories of FCTs of 50 commercial
	species complexes were conducted before and after logging in 50 m-radius
	zones of impact around each designated harvest tree in three 10 ha
	(200 m ? 500 m) logging blocks. We also mapped all forested areas
	potentially influenced by logging, including skid trails, log landings
	and felling gaps, throughout the 30 ha logged. More than 28% of the
	forest area was disturbed by logging, with 12.1% in skid trails and
	16.8% in gap clearings, indicating that the forest gap mosaic can
	be significantly altered even when reduced-impact logging guidelines
	are followed. Overall, 15% of FCTs inventoried were damaged. Damage
	rates were not significantly reduced by marking treatment, location
	in bamboo-dominated forest, or liana load on FCT damage. Harvest
	intensity did not influence the probability of FCT damage. For future
	studies, it would be prudent to address impacts of timber extraction
	on other livelihood activities, such as non-timber forest product
	collection, particularly in such regions as the Brazilian Amazon,

	The results showed that the expected basal area of hardwoods, mainly

	by the deterministic model. A parallel stochastic model of prices
	was also developed from past data. It showed that real prices had

	stand and price models were simulated simultaneously to obtain the
	probabilities of transition between stand and market states. This
	transition probability matrix was used in Markov decision-process
	models to calculate the best decision in each possible stand and
	market state. The policies examined included maximizing net present
	value, or expected tree diversity, production, or annual returns,
	subject to constraints on net present value, expected tree diversity,
	and basal area. A general mathematical programming method is presented
	to optimize economic or ecological objective functions subject to
	multiple constraints with or without time discounting. In the French
	Jura context, the solutions suggested that high net present value
	could be obtained while maintaining the average basal area near its
	current level, and keeping a high level of tree diversity. Accounting
	for risk called for more intense harvesting to raise revenues, and
	it led to stands that were much more diverse than suggested by deterministic

	used two complementary approaches to evaluate the influence of historical

	ant (Linepithema humile), a widespread, highly invasive species native
	to South America. Occurrence data were combined with environmental
	data at incremental spatial scales (extent and resolution) to predict

	In addition, we also used a spread model that simulated the jump
	dispersal of the species to identify the most plausible scenarios
	of arrival of L. humile in the NE Iberian Peninsula at local scales.
	Based on the results of both modelling practices, we suggest that
	L. humile might have reached its maximum geographic range at regional
	scales in the NE Iberian Peninsula. However, the species does not
	appear in equilibrium with the environment at small spatial scales,
	and further expansions are expected along coastal and inland localities
	of the Costa Brava. Long-distance jumps are ultimately responsible
	for the spread of the Argentine ant in the area. Overall, our study
	shows the utility of combining niche based models with spread models
	to understand the dynamics of species' invasions.},

	dynamics is necessary to conserve at-risk species, control invasive
	species and sustainably harvest non-timber forest products (NTFP).
	For NTFP, knowledge about how the sustainability of harvest varies
	by plant life-form and part harvested is limited and needed to inform
	management of the thousands of species providing income to millions
	of people world-wide. 2. Matrix population models are commonly used
	to generate management recommendations. We reviewed studies of 46
	NTFP species that used matrix models and synthesize the current knowledge
	on harvest effects. For 19 species with harvested and control populations,
	we assessed the impacts of harvest on projected population growth
	rates (?) using meta-analysis and analysed trends in population responses
	to harvest across species, life-forms and plant part harvested using
	elasticity and life table response experiment (LTRE) analyses, and
	the combination of both, to assess vulnerability to harvest. 3. NTFP
	harvest significantly reduced ? across species. On the scale of individual
	studies, however, ? provided little information about harvest sustainability
	unless replication was sufficiently high. Most studies had low levels
	of replication over space or time and did not include contrasting
	levels of harvest. 4. Whole-plant harvest of herbs and bark harvest
	from trees were not sustainable largely because of decreases in survival.
	Palm leaf or fruit harvest and rattan stem harvest were potentially
	sustainable. Combined elasticity?LTRE analysis was especially valuable
	in assessing the sustainability of harvest when differences in ?
	between harvested and control populations were small, for studies
	with limited replicates, and where harvest effects varied regionally.
	5. Synthesis and applications. The use of matrix models to assess
	the impacts of NTFP harvest is still rare in regions where trade
	of wild plants is heaviest and for several commonly harvested life-forms.
	Given the high variance in estimates for most NTFP species, ? does
	not provide a precise assessment of harvest impacts. We recommend
	that managers consider the combined elasticity?LTRE analysis in addition
	to ? in making management decisions for NTFP. NTFP research that
	accounts for environmental drivers of population dynamics in addition
	to harvest should be prioritized.},

  abstract = {When plants are competing, larger individuals often obtain a disproportionate
	share of the contested resources and suppress the growth of their
	smaller neighbors, a phenomenon called size-asymmetric competition.
	We review what is known about the mechanisms that give rise to and
	modify the degree of size asymmetry in competition among plants,
	and attempt to clarify some of the confusion in the literature on
	size asymmetry. We broadly distinguish between mechanisms determined
	primarily by characteristics of contested resource from those that
	are influenced by the growth and behavior of the plants themselves.
	To generate size asymmetric resource competition, a resource must
	be "pre-emptable." Because of its directionality, light is the primary,
	but perhaps not the only, example of a pre-emptable resource. The
	available data suggest that competition for mineral nutrients is
	often size symmetric (i.e., contested resources are divided in proportion
	to competitor sizes), but the potential role of patchily and/or episod
	ically supplied nutrients in causing size asymmetry is largely unexplored.
	Virtually nothing is known about the size symmetry of competition
	for water. Plasticity in morphology and physiology acts to reduce
	the degree of size asymmetry in competition. We argue that an allometric
	perspective on growth, allocation, resource uptake, and resource
	utilization can help us understand and quantify the mechanisms through
	which plants compete.},

	height and wood mass density. The plots contained an average of 20
	tree species ha-1 (range 11?29) and 344 stems ha-1 (range 281?382)
	with Shannon diversity values of 1.05 and 1.25, respectively. We
	weighted nine previously published woody savannah allometric models
	based on whether: (i) the model was derived from the same geographical
	region; (ii) the model included tree height/wood mass density in
	addition to stem diameter; and (iii) sample size was used to fit
	the model. The weighted mean ABGC storage from the nine models range
	from 13.5 ? 2 to 29.8 ? 5 Mg ha-1. Measured ABGC storage in the herbaceous
	layer, using the wet combustion method, adds 0.55 ? 0.02 Mg C ha-1.
	Estimates suggest that EAM miombo woodlands store a range of 13?30
	Mg ha-1 of carbon. Although the estimates suggest that miombo woodlands
	store significant quantities of carbon, caution is required as this
	is the first estimate based on in situ data.},

	MELA is an operational information system, or a synthesis tool, for

	The system was originally designed in the late 1970s for the analysis
	of long term timber production possibilities at regional and national
	levels based on the sample plot and sample tree data of the Finnish
	National Forest Inventory. Besides the regular determination of the

  abstract = {1 Stage projection (Lefkovitch) matrices for 21 species of woody plants
	and 45 herbaceous perennials were extracted from the plant demographic
	literature or compiled from published data. 2 Each matrix was divided
	into six regions representing: 1, recruitment of seeds to the seed
	pool; 2, recruitment of seedlings or juveniles from current seed
	production; 3, clonal growth; 4, retrogression, due to plants decreasing
	in size or reverting in stage; 5, stasis, (survival from one year
	to the next in the same stage class); 6, progression to later stage
	classes. 3 Matrix analysis was used to calculate the finite rate
	of increase $\lambda$ for each population and to calculate the elasticities
	of each transition coefficient in the matrices. Elasticities were
	summed within each of the six regions of the matrix to give measures
	($E_1 - E_6$, respectively) of the importance of each component of
	the life cycle to $\lambda$ and fitness. 4 Herbs as a group differed
	significantly from woody plants in most of these components. Seedling
	recruitment was more important in herbs than woody plants. Retrogression
	occurred only in herbs, particularly those with a tuber. Stasis occurred
	in nearly all species, but was most important in woody plants. Progression
	was more important than fecundity in almost all species. 5 Trade-offs
	among life cycle components were determined from correlation matrices
	of $r (= \ln \lambda)$ and elasticities $E_1 - E_6$ for the whole
	sample and for herbs and woody plants separately. As a whole, $r$
	was positively correlated with elasticities for fecundity $(E_1 +
	E_2)$ and growth $(E_3 + E_6)$ and negatively correlated with survival
	$(E_4 + E_5)$. In clonal herbs, fecundity and clonal growth were
	negatively correlated. 6 The division of elasticities into three
	major components (growth, $G = E_3 + E_6$; fecundity, $F = E_1 +
	E_2$; and survival, $L = E_4 + E_5$) allowed us to construct triangular
	plots in $G-L-F$ space. This was done separately for iteroparous
	forest herbs, iteroparous herbs from open habitats, semelparous herbs
	and woody plants. Each of these four groups occupied a distinct position
	in $G-L-F$ space. Within woody plants, shrubs of fire-prone habitats
	occupied the end of the distribution with the lowest survival elasticity.
	7 It is argued that the demographic approach to the classification
	of distinct ecological groups offers new insights into the relationship
	between life history and habitat.},

	developing forest stands. Peak production almost invariably occurs
	as peak community leaf area is obtained. Substantial changes in canopy
	architecture, production efficiency, and tree population structure
	occur at this point, resulting in declining stand-level production.
	These changes are emergent properties that must be studied and understood

  abstract = {Spatial and temporal patterns of riverine woodlands in arid regions
	of Africa are poorly documented despite their considerable conservation
	value. We studied 1540 ha of riverine woodland in the lower Turkwel
	River floodplain, Kenya, between 1990 and 1998. Forty-one woodland
	patches were mapped and their soil physical and chemical characteristics,
	tree species diversity, woody cover, tree density, wood volume and
	woodland regeneration were determined. The riverine woodland comprised
	nine vegetation types and a total of 14 woody species. Woodland patch
	mosaics were associated with microtopographical features and selected
	soil attributes. The most important woody species were Hyphaene compressa
	H. Wendl., Acacia tortilis (Forssk.) Hayne and Cadaba rotundifolia
	Forssk. The exotic Prosopis chilensis (Mol.) St. was invading parts
	of the riverine woodland. Overall, woody species diversity was low
	compared to similar riverine woodlands in East Africa. Tree density,
	wood volume and woody plant regeneration declined over the 8-year
	study period, while woody cover was unchanged. Reduced tree density,
	wood volume and regeneration of woody species might be linked to
	changes in river flood patterns following the impoundment of the
	Turkwel Gorge Dam. It is suggested that spatially heterogeneous and
	temporally stochastic regeneration events, together with occasional
	tree mortality caused by channel abandonment, create the complex
	pattern of woodland patches in the lower Turkwel River floodplain.
	The mapped woodland patches may serve as monitoring units, which
	in future could reveal the interplay between changes in flooding
	patterns as a result of dam impoundment, anthropogenic disturbance
	and the well-being of the riverine woodlands.},

	?10 cm dbh was 552 ? 13 ha-1and the basal area was 30.85 ? 1.38 m2
	ha-1, and showed little variation over the study period: diameter
	class distributions did not change significantly. There were 120
	species of tree ?10 cm dbh, including seven immigrants and seven
	emigrants. Mortality did not differ significantly between diameter
	classes, but was significantly greater amongst trees showing negative
	diameter increment. Total mortality for the 2 ha over the 12-year
	period 1970?1982 was 216 trees (1.77% yr-l) and was balanced by a
	recruitment of 212 trees to the measured population. Growth rates
	were highly variable within species populations. Overall, bigger
	trees tended to have higher growth rates. Successive diameter increments
	in individual trees were strongly correlated, and were still significant
	after 10 years. These results support the idea that the faster-growing
	individuals are the more likely to reach the canopy. Estimates of
	the age of trees by summing mean passage times for successive diameter
	classes is shown to be misleading because similar calculations using
	only the fastest-growing trees gives substantially lower estimated
	ages. Although overall forest composition showed little change, a
	few species showed small but significant imbalance between recruitment
	and mortality. Recruitment and mortality differed significantly from
	overall rates for some species, but only markedly for the megaphanerophyte
	Celtis mildbraedii which had lower than average rates for both mortality
	and recruitment.},

  volume = {80},
  pages = {313-324},
  number = {3},
  abstract = {Ecosystem management implies a concern over time periods of tens to
	hundreds of years for sites on a scale of tens to hundreds of hectares.
	Decision makers need to be able to model the likely consequences
	of alternative management strategies at these temporal and spatial
	scales. They therefore require models that can be constructed quickly
	and cheaply, that capture the key components of the ecosystem, that
	respond plausibly to management actions, and are easy to explain,
	modify and understand. This paper presents the frame-based modelling
	paradigm as a response to these needs. The model developed is described
	as a parsimonious model of forest succession; it uses expert systems
	technology and and the artificial intelligence concept of a frame.
	The model is used to examine the effects of soil, weather, fire and
	deer population density on management of the white pine (Pinus strobus)
	ecosystem in NW Minnesota. The management objective is to maintain
	white pine forest in this area of hemlock [Tsuga canadensis]/white
	pine/northern hardwoods. The paper describes how current understanding
	of seedling establishment, tree growth, competition, herbivory and
	the effects of fire and high winds, can be captured at a consistent
	level of resolution in a model that can be presented completely in
	a few pages of text. The paper goes on to describe how the model
	was tested at 3 sites in northern Minnesota, and was then used to
	explore alternative management strategies. The results confirm that
	it is comparatively easy to maintain a forest in early successional
	stages by burning or clear felling, and in late stages by suppression
	of fires and control of felling. Establishment and maintenance of
	mid-successional stages, such as red (Pinus resinosa) and white pine,
	is much more difficult and requires a finely tuned balance between
	natural disturbance and management action. For example, the pine
	forest was only maintained on average for 117 years out of 1000 years
	(average among 1000 simulated stands) on poor soil with high fire
	frequency and high deer density. When the deer population was low,
	when all wild fires were suppressed, and when prescribed ground fires
	were used to promote pine establishment, years in pine were 804 out
	of 1000 years. The model provides guidance for management decisions
	to maintain the desired conditions. The paper draws some conclusions
	from this particular modelling exercise that are likely to be generally
	applicable. For example, the modelling exercise illustrates limits
	to what management can hope to achieve, the importance of maintaining
	strategies over long time periods, and the difficulties of predicting
	and measuring success when the time horizon is hundreds of years.},

	in French Guiana (northeastern Amazonia) 1 year and 10 years after
	selective logging and compared with bird community composition and
	structure in undisturbed primary forest. A point-count method was
	used in which 937 0.25-ha sample quadrats were censused for 20 minutes
	each. Whereas logging removed little more than 3 trees/ha, 38% of
	the forest undergrowth was destroyed and a higher proportion of the
	canopy was opened or damaged. An overall 27-33% decrease of species
	richness, frequency, and abundance occurred after logging, with a
	less marked decline of diversity and evenness indices, a substantial
	increase in the proportion of dominant species, and a 45% difference
	in species composition, weighed by frequency, between logged and
	undisturbed forest communities. Forty-two percent of the species
	from the primary forest decreased sharply or disappeared after logging
	and only 34% increased or remained unchanged. Microhabitat selection
	was the main correlate of sensitivity to disturbance. Most affected
	by logging were species associated with the understory of tall mature
	stands especially terrestrial species, members of mixed flocks, and
	solitary sallying insectivores, all of which decreased by 70% to
	over 90%. Most birds associated with canopy, small gaps, and vine
	tangles declined by only 10-30%. Small frugivores and species associated
	with clearings or edges increased. Among other factors, physiological
	intolerance of understory species to open forest microclimatic conditions
	(light, heat, or water stress) might influence their avoidance of
	logged areas. Timber harvesting generated a high level of disturbance,
	which depressed the bird diversity. After over 10 years of regeneration,
	the dense regrowth produced a uniform habitat type that still had
	not recovered the high species richness exhibited by the primary
	forest under an intermediate level of disturbance.},

  abstract = {We present a first assessment of the potential impacts of anthropogenic
	climate change on the endemic flora of Namibia, and on its vegetation
	structure and function, for a projected climate in ?2050 and ?2080.
	We used both niche-based models (NBM) to evaluate the sensitivity
	of 159 endemic species to climate change (of an original 1020 plant
	species modeled) and a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) to
	assess the impacts of climate change on vegetation structure and
	ecosystem functioning. Endemic species modeled by NBM are moderately
	sensitive to projected climate change. Fewer than 5% are predicted
	to experience complete range loss by 2080, although more than 47%
	of the species are expected to be vulnerable (range reduction >30%)
	by 2080 if they are assumed unable to migrate. Disaggregation of
	results by life-form showed distinct patterns. Endemic species of
	perennial herb, geophyte and tree life-formsare predicted to be negatively
	impacted in Namibia, whereas annual herb and succulent endemic species
	remain relatively stable by 2050 and 2080. Endemic annual herb species
	are even predicted to extend their range north-eastward into the
	tree and shrub savanna with migration, and tolerance of novel substrates.
	The current protected area network is predicted to meet its mandate
	by protecting most of the current endemicity in Namibia into the
	future. Vegetation simulated by DGVM is projected to experience a
	reduction in cover, net primary productivity and leaf area index
	throughout much of the country by 2050, with important implications
	for the faunal component of Namibia's ecosystems, and the agricultural
	sector. The plant functional type (PFT) composition of the major
	biomes may be substantially affected by climate change and rising
	atmospheric CO2? currently widespread deciduous broad leaved trees
	and C4 PFTs decline, with the C4 PFT particularly negatively affected
	by rising atmospheric CO2 impacts by ?2080 and deciduous broad leaved
	trees more likely directly impacted by drying and warming. The C3
	PFT may increase in prominence in the northwestern quadrant of the
	country by ?2080 as CO2 concentrations increase. These results suggest
	that substantial changes in species diversity, vegetation structure
	and ecosystem functioning can be expected in Namibia with anticipated
	climate change, although endemic plant richness may persist in the
	topographically diverse central escarpment region.},

	forest structure, using 89 200 stems ? 10 cm dbh from 220 1-ha permanent
	plots distributed along environmental gradients in lowland Bolivia.
	Fifteen forest structural variables, related to vertical structure
	(forest height and layering), horizontal structure (basal area, median
	and the 99th percentile of the stem diameter and size-class distribution)
	and density of life forms (tree, palm and liana), were evaluated.
	Environmental variables were summarized in four multivariate axes,
	related to rainfall, temperature, soil fertility and soil texture.
	Multiple regression indicates that all structural variables were
	affected by one or more of the environmental axes, but the explained
	variation was generally low (median R2 = 0.15). Rainfall and soil
	texture affected most forest structural variables (respectively 87%
	and 80%) and had qualitatively similar effects. This suggests that
	plant water availability, as determined by rainfall and soil water
	retention capacity, is the strongest driver of forest structure,
	whereas soil fertility was a weaker driver of forest structure, affecting
	53% of the variables. Maximum forest height, palm density, total
	basal area and liana infestation showed the strongest responses to
	environmental variation (with R2 ranging from 0.31?0.82). Forest
	height, palm density and total basal area increased with plant water
	availability, while liana infestation decreased with plant water
	availability. Therefore, multiple rather than single environmental
	factors must be used to explain the structure of tropical forests.},

	Highway 150 in eastern Amazonia. Of the 48 sawmills present in the
	environs of Tail\^andia in 1989, 70% had been established since 1985,
	when Par\'a Highway 150 was asphalted. These mills generally contained
	one band saw and produced 250?350 m3 of sawn wood per month. Wood-use
	efficiency was low; frequently, 3 m3 of bole were required to produce
	1 m3 of sawn wood. The loggers who supply wood to mills have become
	the main catalysts for the building of secondary roads in the region:
	of 272 km of side-roads that we surveyed, two-thirds had been built
	by loggers, frequently in exchange for partial logging rights on
	the lands of ranchers and agricultural colonists. Most of the logging
	occurs on 50 ha lots occupied by colonists. In interviews with 59
	colonist families, we found that 86% were involved, either actively
	or passively, in logging activities. Those passively involved (61%
	of all families) simply sold trees in their forest tracts from time
	to time, whereas the ?active colonists? (25%) participated in the
	logging process. Logging roads and landings are opened by hand, using
	machetes and chainsaws. Seventy minutes of human labor are expended
	for each cubic meter of wood prepared for extraction. The energy
	expenditure per cubic meter of wood prepared for extraction is approximately
	3000 kcal; 90% of this energy is in the form of the fossil fuels
	required to operate chainsaws. Considerable damage occurs in the
	logging process. We determined that an average of 2.0 trees or 16
	m3 ha-1 were harvested in three study areas, each approximately 16
	ha in size. The number of trees of 10 cm or greater dbh (diameter
	at breast height) damaged in the logging process averaged 58 ha-1
	or 29 trees per tree harvested. Expressed in terms of volume, 1.2
	m3 of bole were damaged for each cubic meter of wood harvested. Most
	logging damage (55%) was concentrated in the canopy openings created
	in the felling process. These openings were good sites for forest
	regeneration, 15 months after logging had ceased, logging openings
	contained, on average, 63 seedlings of timber species (0.2 individuals

	Multivariate analyses of dissimilarity or similarity in assemblages

	repeated use of the sample-units. Where rank-order procedures are
	used, no comparative quantitative measurements of dissimilarity at
	different scales are produced. An alternative method is described
	that uses the sample's average assemblage (or centroid). These estimates
	are themselves averaged to give centroids for larger spatial scales.
	Dissimilarities from the centroids at each scale are then calculated
	using independent replicates for each scale from those in each sample.
	The dissimilarity measures can then be examined by analysis of variance
	to detect spatial scales of differences for each sample at every
	level of a hierarchy of scales. The method is illustrated using data
	from mangrove forests and rocky shores, involving up to 97 taxonomic
	groups (species, other taxa). Differences among assemblages at the
	scales of sites (tens of meters apart) or locations at shores (hundreds
	of meters apart) were identified. Consequences of different numbers

	and much of ecology in general. Consequently, the topic has invited
	a vast commentary. One result of scaling research is so-called scaling
	laws that describe how observations scale (e.g., as power laws).
	Importantly, such scaling rules seldom derive from a process-based
	understanding of why they emerge. Alternatively, the task of scaling
	is often addressed via simulation models. This is a scaling operation
	about which we are somewhat less confident, although recent advances
	in computing power and computational statistics provide for some
	promising new solutions. Here, I focus on methods for scaling simulations
	developed at fine grain and small extent, to their implications over
	much larger extent. The intent in scaling is to simplify the model
	while retaining those details essential for larger-scale applications.
	This approach should lead to scaling rules that are well founded
	in fine-scale ecological process and yet useful for making predictions
	at the larger scales of management and environmental policy.},

	regressions revealed a positive relationship between ES and local
	abundance for most species (>84%). The relationships for these species

  abstract = {The Brazilian wood industry is highly mobile. Over the past 20 years
	the eastern Amazon developed from a logging backwater to the principal
	hardwood processing center in Brazil. This occurred because of a
	decline in hardwood stocks in the south of Brazil coupled with the
	development of good transport, energy, and communications systems
	in eastern Amazonia. We studied the structure and economy of the
	wood industry along a 340 km stretch of the B\'elem-Bras\'{\i}lia
	Highway in eastern Amazonia. Of the 238 sawmills present in this
	study region in late 1989, 79% were installed in the 1980s. Ninety-seven
	percent of the mill owners came from outside Amazonia. Most (63%)
	of the mill establishments were vertically integrated, engaging in
	both forest mill processing and forest logging. Logging establishments
	realize substantial profits. A typical sawmill with one band saw
	produces, on average, 4300 m3 of sawnwood year-1 from 9200 m3 of
	roundwood. The value of this sawn production is estimated at $670
	800 or $156 m-3. Production costs are $116 m-3 giving an annual mill
	profit of $170 000. For firms engaged in both logging and processing
	activities, annual profits were estimated at $217 000 (profit margin,
	32%) or $900 ha-1 logged. An average of six trees were harvested
	per hectare in logging operations (n = 3 study areas) and the volume
	yield averaged 38 m3 ha-1. Damages to the forest during logging are
	significant. Twenty-seven trees greater than or equal to 10 cm dbh
	are severely damaged for each tree harvested. This damage occurs
	in the opening of approximately 40 m of logging road and 600 m2 of
	canopy per tree harvested. Vines are favored by these open conditions
	and forest fires are possible. Forest management is technically feasible
	but economically unattractive. Natural regeneration is abundant on
	logged sites: 4300 seedlings and saplings of economic species were
	registered per hectare. Stocking of larger trees of economic species
	with good form is also adequate: 16 trees ha-1 greater than or equal
	to 30 cm dbh. This residual stock could be favored by vine cutting
	and refinement thinnings at an estimated cost of $180 ha-1. Although
	these treatments result in increased growth rates, the projected
	return on management investments is low. Nonetheless, given the robust
	profits in the wood sector, profit margins would remain well above
	20% if management were mandated by law. At present the biggest impediment
	to forest management in the eastern Amazon is the undervaluing of
	the timber resource. Ranchers, who own most forest land, sell harvest
	rights to loggers at low prices -$50?$150 ha-1. After the logging
	teams extract the timber, these same ranchers are left with badly
	damaged forest tracts. With careful extraction and management procedures,
	harvests could be accomplished on a 30- to 40-year rotation and forest
	integrity could be maintained. Ranchers, insofar as they control
	the forest resource, have the power to guarantee its wise use. They
	could do this by supervising harvest operations on their lands to
	reduce damage and by raising the price of their timber and using
	this additional revenue to finance simple silvicultural operations.},

	scales with neighbor distance in a target-neighbor greenhouse competition
	experiment. Individuals from co-occurring forbs from calcareous grasslands
	were grown in isolation and with single conspecific or heterospecific
	neighbors at distances of 5, 10, or 15 cm (Plantago lanceolata vs.
	Plantago media and Hieracium pilosella vs. Prunella grandiflora).
	Neighbor effects were strong and declined with distance. Interaction
	distances varied greatly within and between species, but we found
	no evidence for heteromyopia. Instead, neighbor identity effects
	were mostly explained by relative size differences between target
	and neighbor. We found a complex interaction between final neighbor
	size and identity such that neighbor identity may become important
	only as the neighbor becomes very large compared with the target
	individual. Our results suggest that species-specific size differences
	between neighboring individuals determine both the strength of competitive
	interactions and the distance over which these interactions occur.},

	intermediate and common species. The aggregation intensity declines
	with increasing size class (diameter at breast height), i.e., species
	become more regularly spaced as species grow, which is consistent
	with the predictions of self-thinning and Janzen?Connell spacing
	effects. Species functional traits (canopy layer, seed dispersal
	ability, shade tolerant, etc) also havea significant effect on the
	spatial distributions of species. Our results partially conform to

  abstract = {Financing for logging of tropical moist forests in the Republic of
	Congo is commonly sought in the form of loans from multilateral development
	banks. Pressure from nongovernmental conservation organizations and
	from within the banks themselves has resulted in their beginning
	to assess the environmental consequences of such loans. We conducted
	one of the first such assessments of an African Development Bank
	loan to a logging company. Geographic isolation, resulting transportation
	costs, and market demands have forced commercial loggers within the
	Sangha region of Congo to exploit only the most valuable timber.
	This form of timber extraction destroys an average of 6.8% of the
	canopy and thus, unlike clear cutting, was expected to have a minimal
	impact on wildlife populations. Line transect counts showed, however,
	that primate abundance was exceedingly low in logged forest. We believe
	this is not a direct consequence of canopy reduction, but results
	from the extremely intensive market hunting that coincides with timber
	surveying and extraction. Weapons and hunting camps were common,
	and logging company vehicles transported primates, duikers, and other
	game daily. Wildlife laws of Congo are openly violated and they are
	not enforced. While market hunting is clearly facilitated and intensified
	by the presence of logging concessions, it is the Congo's highly
	urbanized population that provides the ever growing demand for meat,
	a demand not being met through animal husbandry. Thus, although selective
	logging in the absence of hunting may have only limited adverse effects
	on wildlife, when the two are combined the consequences are grave
	for the Sangha region's wildlife. Loans to logging companies from
	the African Development Bank should incorporate conditions for ensuring
	wildlife conservation.},

	and disturbance, important flows in the carbon cycle that are widely
	tested against flux towers and CO2 concentration gradients. The resulting
	forest biomass is examined in this paper for its resemblance to realistic
	stands, which are characterized using allometric theory. The simulated
	biomass pools largely do not conform to widely observed allometry,
	particularly for young stands. The best performing models had an
	explicit treatment of stand-thinning processes, which brought the
	slope of the allometry of these models closer to observations. Additionally,
	models that had relatively shorter wood turnover times performed
	were generally closer to observed allometries. The discrepancy between
	the pool distribution between models and data suggests estimates
	of NEE have biases when integrated over the long term, as compared
	to observed biomass data, and could therefore compromise long-term
	predictions of land carbon sources and sinks. We think that this
	presents a practical obstacle for improving models by informing them
	better with data. The approach taken in this paper, examining biomass
	pools allometrically, offers a simple approach to improving the characteristic
	behaviors of global models with the relatively sparse data that is
	available globally by forest inventory.},

	in the atmosphere suggests that the global net release of carbon
	due to forest clearing between 1860 and 1980 was between 135 ? 1015
	and 228 ? 1015 grams. Between 1.8 ? 1015 and 4.7 ? 1015 grams of
	carbon were released in 1980, of which nearly 80 percent was due
	to deforestation, principally in the tropics. The annual release
	of carbon from the biota and soils exceeded the release from fossil
	fuels until about 1960. Because the biotic release has been and remains
	much larger than is commonly assumed, the airborne fraction, usually
	considered to be about 50 percent of the release from fossil fuels,
	was probably between 22 and 43 percent of the total carbon released
	in 1980. The increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is thought
	by some to be increasing the storage of carbon in the earth's remaining
	forests sufficiently to offset the release from deforestation. The
	interpretation of the evidence presented here suggests no such effect;
	deforestation appears to be the dominant biotic effect on atmospheric
	carbon dioxide. If deforestation increases in proportion to population,
	the biotic release of carbon will reach 9 ? 1015 grams per year before
	forests are exhausted early in the next century. The possibilities
	for limiting the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
	through reduction in use of fossil fuels and through management of
	forests may be greater than is commonly assumed.}

  abstract = {The future of tropical forests has become one of the iconic issues
	in climate-change science. A number of studies that have explored
	this subject have tended to focus on the output from one or a few
	climate models, which work at low spatial resolution, whereas society
	and conservation-relevant assessment of potential impacts requires
	a finer scale. This study focuses on the role of climate on the current
	and future distribution of humid tropical forests (HTFs). We first
	characterize their contemporary climatological niche using annual
	rainfall and maximum climatological water stress, which also adequately
	describe the current distribution of other biomes within the tropics.
	As a first-order approximation of the potential extent of HTFs in
	future climate regimes defined by global warming of 2?C and 4?C,
	we investigate changes in the niche through a combination of climate-change
	anomaly patterns and higher resolution (5 km) maps of current climatology.
	The climate anomalies are derived using data from 17 coupled Atmosphere?Ocean
	General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) used in the Fourth Assessment
	of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change. Our results confirm
	some risk of forest retreat, especially in eastern Amazonia, Central
	America and parts of Africa, but also indicate a potential for expansion
	in other regions, for example around the Congo Basin. The finer spatial
	scale enabled the depiction of potential resilient and vulnerable
	zones with practically useful detail. We further refine these estimates
	by considering the impact of new environmental regimes on plant water
	demand using the UK Met Office land-surface scheme (of the HadCM3
	AOGCM). The CO2-related reduction in plant water demand lowers the
	risk of die-back and can lead to possible niche expansion in many
	regions. The analysis presented here focuses primarily on hydrological
	determinants of HTF extent. We conclude by discussing the role of
	other factors, notably the physiological effects of higher temperature.},

  abstract = {Regression modeling of biomass estimates from an airborne, multiple
	return lidar system using regional biomass allometric equations differs
	significantly from those using national scale Jenkins allometric
	equations with respect to the amount of variation explained, variables
	selected and variables of importance. Our discrete return lidar data
	were collected in September 2007 at 121 plots in a conifer dominated
	forest site in the Sierra Nevada mountains that include a full range
	of forest density. We regressed field plot-level estimates of biomass
	derived from field data and two different allometric equations with
	a range of lidar metrics. We compared regression performance across
	eight models: (1) point clouds alone, (2) point clouds with an empirical
	relationship between DBH and height (i.e., volume), (3) individual
	tree-level metrics, and (4) all data combined, and across two allometric
	equations ? (A) Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA), and (B) Jenkins.
	In lower biomass plots, the reference above ground biomass (AGB)
	estimates from regional allometric equations and Jenkins equations
	were closely related; in plots with large biomass they were different.
	This finding suggests that published equations from large biomass
	plots are either not readily available or less represented in national
	scale allometric equation compiling. Models using reference AGBs
	calculated from regional allometric equations performed much better
	than those using reference AGBs calculated from Jenkins allometric
	equations. In these cases adjusted R2 improvement ranged from 0.07
	to 0.11. The regression model that used regional allometric equations
	with lidar metrics and individual tree data provided the best overall
	R2 (0.79) with lowest RMSE suggesting that in most conditions regional
	biomass equations should be preferred over national equations. The
	inclusion of volumetric metrics shows that lidar variables are more
	sensitive to the reference AGBs calculated from regional allometric
	equations, and care should be taken when substituting regional equations
	using national scale compiled allometric equations in regional biomass
	studies. In addition, consistent with previous studies, the mean
	height of individual trees identified was chosen by both models with
	both reference AGBs calculated from regional allometric equations
	and those calculated from Jenkins equations, supporting the need
	to identify individual trees for biomass prediction. Based on these
	results, we conclude that the selection of allometric equations can
	influence the capacity of lidar data to estimate biomass significantly,
	and a careful selection of allometric equations is required for regional
	lidar biomass studies.},
