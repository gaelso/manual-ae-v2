
## Sampling to construct volume tables

As a first step, let us consider the problem of predicting the volume or biomass of a particular tree using volume or biomass tables. How many trees need to be measured to construct the tables (\S\ \@ref(size))? Which trees in the stand should be selected for measurement? This second question begs another: how should we sort the trees in the sample in relation to volume table entry variables, starting with the tree size (\S\ \@ref(vent))? How, if necessary, should we stratify the sample (\S\ \@ref(stratif))? Is it best to select individuals far apart in the forest, or on the contrary inventory all the trees in a given plot (\S\ \@ref(sel))?


### Number of trees {#size}

Given the limitations of the sampling theory, the number of measured trees for volume or biomass (in other terms, the sample size) is generally selected empirically, based on rules established by experience. A general principle is that, for any given precision, the more variable the material, the larger the sample size: smaller sample sizes are required for a plantation of clones than for a natural tropical forest, for a given species than for a group of species, for a 10 ha plot than for a natural area. In certain cases, such as for root biomass, it is the cost of the measurements that determines the sample size rather than the desired precision of the predictions: the number of trees selected corresponds to an acceptable amount of work to obtain the measurements. As a rough guide, when constructing volume tables, the Forester's Memento [@ctft89, p.256] recommends measuring about 100 trees "for one or more stands of recent plantation over a small surface area (e.g. silviculture research plots)". Pard√© & Bouchon [-@parde88, p.108] recommended the sample sizes given in Table \@ref(tab:eff), that depend on the surface area of the zone in which the volume tables are to be used. Different volume and biomass tables have been compiled by @zianis05 for Europe and by @henry11 for sub-Saharan Africa. The sample sizes reported for the volume and biomass tables listed in these literature reviews give some idea of the sampling effort required. @chave04 showed that when 300 trees were used to construct a biomass table, the resulting biomass estimation for a wet tropical stand (Barro Colorado Island in Panama) had a coefficient of variation of barely 3.1\ \%. This coefficient of variation rose above 10\ \% when the number of trees used to construct the biomass table fell below 50, with the coefficient of variation increasing approximately in proportion to $1/\sqrt{n}$ [Figure 3 @chave04]. @vanbreugel11 noted the same type of decrease in estimation precision with the sample size used to construct the biomass table, for $n$ between 49 and 195 trees.

```{r eff}

kab_opt <- list(
  x = kab_eff,
  caption = "(ref:eff)",
  caption.short = "Number of trees to be measured to establish a volume table for different surface areas over which the tables are to be used",
  col.names = c("Area", "$n$"),
  booktabs = TRUE,
  escape = F
)

display_table()

```


The costlier an observation, in terms of measurement time and effort, the more the sampling plan tends to be determined by the sampling effort that workers are willing to make rather than by the desired precision of the estimation. As the above-ground biomass of a tree is more difficult to measure than the volume of its stem, biomass tables tend to be constructed using fewer observations than volume tables. Certain biomass tables are constructed from measurements in only a few trees [8 trees for @brown95 in Brazil; 12 trees for @ebuy11 in the Democratic Republic of Congo; 14 trees for @deans96; 15 trees for @russell83 in Brazil].
Root tables, that require an even greater measurement effort, are often based on even smaller sample sizes. Tables constructed using such small samples are generally unreliable, and in any case are valid only very locally. However, these small datasets can subsequently be grouped together into more impressive datasets that have advantages for model fitting (on condition that the variability induced by the merging of these datasets can be controlled by effect covariables: age, wood density, etc. or by stratification factors: species, type of plant formation $\ldots$).


### Sorting trees {#vent}

The sorting of trees in the sample on the basis of their size (and more generally on the basis of table entry variables) can in principle be optimized. For example, in the case of a linear regression, the semi-amplitude of the confidence interval at $\alpha$ of the regression slope is [@saporta90, p.367]:
\[
t_{n-2}\ \frac{\hat{\sigma}}{S_X\sqrt{n}}
\]
where $t_{n-2}$ is the quantile $1-\alpha/2$ of a Student's distribution with $n-2$ degrees of freedom, $\hat{\sigma}$ is the empirical standard deviation of the model's residuals, $n$ is sample size and $S_X$ is the empirical standard deviation of the entry variable $X$ in the sample:
\[
S_X^2=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\bar{X})^2\quad\mbox{where}\quad
\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i
\]
Therefore, the higher the value of $S_X$ the more precise the estimation of the slope, which, for a set sample size, brings us back to a trees breakdown similar to that shown in Figure \@ref(fig:plan). We have already seen the limitations of this reasoning: although the sampling plan that consists in selecting trees at the two extremities of the size gradient is optimal when the conditions of a linear relationship are met, it results in erroneous estimations when the relationship is not linear (Figure \@ref(fig:bad)). It is therefore preferable, in practice, to sample trees right across the size gradient in order to check the form of the relationship between their volume (or their mass) and their size.

The theory of response surfaces [@box87; @goupy99; @myers02] can be used to optimize tree sorting on the basis of dbh (and more generally on the basis of table entry variables). We will not enter into the details of this theory here, but will simply sketch a few general principles. The first principle is to spread the tree size gradient of the sample as broadly as possible.

If the volume (or mass) variance is constant for all tree sizes, the rule is to measure the same number of trees in each size category [@parde88, p.108; @ctft89, p.256]. It would be a mistake to form a sample by selecting in each size class a number of trees proportional to the magnitude of that class in the stand (in other words select the trees at random). But volume variance is rarely constant; generally it increases with tree size (heteroscedasticity of the residuals). The rule is therefore to increase sampling intensity in the most variable classes, thereby improving precision. In theory, the ideal approach is to measure a number of trees in a given size class proportional to the standard deviation of the tree volume in this class [@ctft89, p.256]. In practice, when the entry variable is dbh, an empirical rule consists in selecting the same number of trees per basal area growth class and thus better represent large diameter trees [@ctft89, p.256--257].

This reasoning may be extended to other effect variables. If the table entry variable is $D^2H$, the trees may be sorted by $D^2H$. For multispecific biomass tables, wood density $\rho$ is often used as the entry variable (with the specificity that it concerns the species not the tree). For multispecific tables using diameter $D$ and specific wood density $\rho$ as entry variable, adequate sorting of the trees in the sample consists in dividing them evenly by dbh class and wood density class.



### Stratification {#stratif}

We have already seen for the sorting of trees into size classes that selecting trees at random, and thereby giving all trees and equal *inclusion probability* is a suboptimal sampling plan. Stratification aims to take account of exogenous information to establish homogeneous sampling *strata* and thus improve the precision of our estimations. The principle, in the same manner as previously, is to increase the sampling intensity of the most variable strata (relative to the other strata). Again using the example given in section \@ref(simple), the variance of the regression estimator $\bar{V}$ in the case of a stratified sampling approach becomes [@cochran77, p.202]:
\begin{eqnarray}
\widehat{\mbox{Var}}(\bar{V}) &=&
\sum_h\left(\frac{N_h}{N}\right)^2
\frac{1-n_h/N_h}{n_h(n_h-2)}\left\{
\sum_{i=1}^{n_h}(V_{hi}-\bar{V}_{eh})^2\right.\nonumber
\\ && \left.-\frac{\left[\sum_{i=1}^{n_h}
(V_{hi}-\bar{V}_{eh})(D_{hi}^2H_{hi}-\overline{D^2H}_{eh})\right]^2}
{\sum_{i=1}^{n_h} (D_{hi}^2H_{hi}-
\overline{D^2H}_{eh})^2}\right\}(\#eq:VVh)
\end{eqnarray}
where $h$ is the stratum, $N_h$ the number of individuals in the stand that belong to stratum $h$, $n_h$ is the number of individuals in the sample that belong to stratum $h$, $V_{ih}$ is the volume of the $i$th individual in stratum $h$ in the sample, $\bar{V}_{eh}$ is the empirical mean volume in stratum $h$ of the sample, etc. This formula replaces (\@ref(eq:VV)). Let us now illustrate the precision gained by the stratification using a simple numerical example. Let us suppose, to simplify, that we have two strata, each corresponding to 50\ \% of the stand (such that $N_1/N=N_2/N=0.5$), and that the sampling in each stratum is such that the second term between brackets in (\@ref(eq:VVh)) is negligible. Let us also assume that $n_1\ll N_1$ and $n_2\ll N_2$. The variance of the regression estimator in this case is approximately proportional to:
\[
\widehat{\mbox{Var}}(\bar{V})\propto \frac{1}{n_1-2}\left\{
\frac{1}{n_1}\sum_{i=1}^{n_1}(V_{1i}-\bar{V}_{e1})^2\right\}
+\frac{1}{n_2-2}\left\{\frac{1}{n_2}\sum_{i=1}^{n_2}(V_{2i}
-\bar{V}_{e2})^2\right\}
\]
The terms in brackets represent within-strata variances in volume. Let us suppose that the standard deviation of the volume is 4 m$^3$ in the first stratum and 2 m$^3$ in the second. Total sample size is set at $n_1+n_2=60$ individuals.
If we take account of the stratification, i.e. if we select the number of trees in each stratum in proportion to the frequency $N_h/N$ of the stratum in the stand, then in this case we have the same number of trees in each stratum of the sample: $n_1=n_2=30$ individuals. The variance of the regression estimator is therefore approximately:
\[
\frac{4^2}{30-2}+\frac{2^2}{30-2}=0.71\mbox{ m}^6
\]
By contrast, if we set the number of trees in each stratum in proportion to the standard deviation of the volume in the stratum, then: $n_1=2n_2$, giving $n_1=40$ individuals and $n_2=20$ individuals. The variance of the regression estimator is therefore approximately:
\[
\frac{4^2}{40-2}+\frac{2^2}{20-2}=0.64\mbox{ m}^6
\]
It can thus be seen that from the standpoint of estimator variance, $30+30$ does not equal $40+20$. We can also check that the minimum of the function that at $n_1$ associates $16/(n_1-2)+4/(58-n_1)$ is obtained for $n_1=39.333$.

From the standpoint of sampling theory, stratification aims to increase the precision of the estimation by fitting the sampling plan to the variability in each stratum. But from the standpoint of constructing volume tables, stratification has a second aim that is just as important as the first: check that the relationship between tree volume (or biomass) and size is the same in each stratum and, if needed, break down the tables into as many relations as necessary. This second point is implicit in equation (\@ref(eq:VVh)) that is based on the fitting of a different slope $b$ (see equation \@ref(eq:reg)) in each stratum.

In short, stratification aims to explore the variability of the study area to (*i*) if necessary vary the form of the tables in accordance with the strata, and
(*ii*) fit the sampling plan to the variability in the strata. Often when constructing volume tables, point (*i*) is predominant over point (*ii*), whereas the reverse is true in sampling theory. Figure \@ref(fig:mel) illustrated these two aims.

```{r mel, fig.scap="Predicting volume from tree size in two strata", fig.cap="(ref:mel)"}

knitr::include_graphics(paste0(fig_path, "/badmel.png"), auto_pdf = TRUE)

```


#### Stratification factors {-}

Any factor that can explain the variability in the study area may be envisaged: stand age (above all for plantations), fertility, station, silvicultural treatments, variety or species, altitude, depth of the water table, etc. [@parde88 p.106; @ctft89 p.255]. Stratification factors may be nested: stratification according to morpho-pedological region, then according to fertility in each region, then according to age in each fertility class, then according to density in each age class. The "finenesse" of the stratification factors must also be adapted to match the context. The stratification factors employed are not the same when reasoning on a global scale like @brown97, on a landscape scale like @vanbreugel11, or on the scale of a plantation of clones like @saintandre05. @brown97 proposes "all-species" tables for climatic areas (dry forests, wet forests). At the other extreme, on an "eddy-correlation" plot, and with the aim of comparing NEP estimations, trees may be stratified according to plot age, season and flux tower "foot-print".


#### Species as stratification factor {-}

When dealing with natural formations that contain several species, the species may also be considered as stratification factor. Here, it is routine practice to construct volume tables separately for each species (or at least the most abundant species), then attempt to group gender or group together all the species ("all species" table). By merging the datasets we increase sample size which can be advantageous if this compensates for the increase in variability resulting from the mix of different species. In comparison with a mono-specific model, a multi-specific model introduces a prediction bias that may be viewed as between-species variability. As an illustration, @vanbreugel11 quantified the prediction bias resulting from the aggregation of several species. Therefore, merging the data from several species is advantageous if the gain in within-species variability provided by this merger compensates for the between-species variability introduced. However, a check must be made that (*i*) this merger is meaningful and that (*ii*) the sample sizes for the different species are comparable (Figure \@ref(fig:mel)). If from the outset we are looking to construct "all species" volume table (which is often the case for natural stands), care must be taken to ensure that the individuals are selected for the sample independently of their species, such that the tables are not biased in favor of one particular species.


#### Allocating to strata {-}

Once the strata have been identified, the sampling plan must be adapted to it following empirical rules. If we have an *a priori* estimation of volume variability (for volume tables) or biomass variability (for biomass tables) for each stratum, the empirical rule is to select a sampling intensity in proportion to the standard deviation in each stratum. If no *a priori* estimation of the variability is available, then a constant sampling intensity should be used in each stratum (this does not correspond to random sampling if the strata do not have the same frequency in the stand).


#### Parameterized models {-}

Strata-related information is then incorporated into the volume model by establishing different models for each stratum. We can then test whether the models for the two strata are significantly different and, if appropriate, merge the two datasets to construct a single model. We could also construct a parameterized model from several models for different strata by following the principle of the mixed model: the model's parameters themselves become functions of the variables defining the strata. These different points will be developed in the sections below, devoted to the actual construction of volume/biomass models. By way of an example, @ketterings01 developed individual, single-entry biomass models of the power form:
\[
B=aD^b
\]
where $D$ is the dbh and $B$ biomass of different trees of different species at different sites in the Jambi province of Sumatra in Indonesia. The site factor was then taken into account in parameter $b$ that was written $b=2+c$, where $c$ is the parameter in the allometric equation that links height to dbh at each site: $H=kD^c$. The species factor was taken into account in parameter $a$ that was written $a=r\rho$, where $\rho$ is the wood density of the species and $r$ is a constant parameter. The model finally obtained, and valid for all the species at all the sites, is a parameterized model:
\[
B=r\rho D^{2+c}
\]



### Selecting trees {#sel}

Once the composition of the sample has been established, the trees must be identified and measured in the field. Given that these measurements involve a great deal of work and, when involving biomass, are destructive, the trees used must be selected with great care. A strategy adopted by some when constructing biomass tables is to cut all the trees within a given area (for example half a hectare). This has the advantage of "killing two birds with one stone" in that it provides both a biomass estimate for the stand and individual observations for the construction of a model. From a practical standpoint, the space created by the cutting of the first trees facilitates the subsequent cutting of the next. But this strategy has a major drawback: as the tree size distribution of the trees in the stand has only a very small likelihood of coinciding with the desired sorting of the trees in the sample by size class, the tree size distribution in the sample is suboptimal. The same applies for any factor in the structure of the sample (wood density classes, strata, etc.). Also, the scale of this disturbance in the stand may have unexpected consequences. For instance, @djomo10 reported on a plot that was invaded by ants after the trees had been felled, to such an extent that it was impossible to make any tree biomass measurements. This tree selection strategy should therefore be avoided in areas infested by *Wasmannia* ants as their attacks are highly dangerous.

Rather than selecting all the trees within a given area, preference should be given to selecting stems one by one depending on the requirements of sample constitution. This strategy may be longer to implement as it requires the identification of individual trees. In view of the difficulties inherent to measuring tree biomass (see chapter \@ref(ter)), preference should be given to trees that match the criteria of the sampling plan and are most easily accessible.
